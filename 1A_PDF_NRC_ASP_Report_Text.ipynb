The apparent cause was determined \\nto be a \\ndegradation of the connecting rod aluminum cooling oil spherical retainer ring which resulted in \\nLER 338\\n-\\n2020\\n-\\n001\\n \\n \\n2\\n \\nincreased oil flow and inadequate lubrication between the piston pin and piston pin bushing.  \\nThe licensee investigation concluded that the degradation\\n \\noccurred during the previous start of \\nEDG \\n\\n1J\\n\\n \\nduring surveillance testing completed on January\\n \\n22, 2020.\\n  \\nThe previous successful \\ntest on EDG \\n\\n1J\\n\\n \\nwas completed on December\\n \\n16, 2019.  Repairs were completed on \\nFebruary\\n \\n26\\nth\\n \\nafter successful post\\n-\\nmaintenance testing.\\n  \\nAdditional information is provided in \\nlicensee event report (LER) 3\\n38\\n-\\n20\\n-\\n001\\n\\nDegraded Upper Cylinder Piston Pin Bushing \\nDiscovered during Maintenance Activities on Emergency Diesel Generator\\n\\nNo.\\n \\nML20122A056\\n).\\n \\nCause.\\n  \\nLicensee investigation revealed that the failure of EDG \\n\\nwas caused by t\\nhe \\ndegrad\\nation on number 1 upper cylinder piston pin bushing.  \\nI\\nnadequate lubrication between the \\npiston pin and bushing resulted from increased oil flow due to degradation of a connecting rod \\ncooling oil spherical retainer ring.\\n \\n3\\n \\nMODELING \\n \\n \\n3.1\\n \\nSDP \\nResults/Basis for ASP Analysis\\n \\nThe ASP Program uses SDP results for degraded conditions when available (and applicable).  \\nThe\\n \\nNRC \\ninspection of this event \\nis documented in \\ninspection report 05000338/2020003\\n\\nAnna Power Station \\n\\n \\nIntegrated Inspection Report 05000338/2020003 and 05000339/2020003 \\n\\n.\\n \\nML20310A166)\\n. \\n \\nThe \\ninspectors determined that \\n\\nlicensee and, therefore, the technical specification (TS) violation was not a result of \\ndeficient \\nlicensee \\nperformance\\n \\nand was \\naddressed using tra\\n\\nEnforcement Policy\\n.  \\nThe LER is closed.  \\nAn independent ASP analysis was performed because \\nthere was no\\n \\nperformance deficiency identified and\\n, therefore, not SDP risk evaluation was \\nperformed\\n.\\n \\n \\nA search for windowed events revealed a concurrent unavailability \\nof \\nEDG\\n \\n\\nSpecifically, \\nLER\\n \\n338\\n-\\n20\\n-\\n001\\n \\nst\\nates th\\nat\\n \\nEDG\\n \\n\\nfor \\nsurveillance testing and \\nmaintenance for\\n \\napproximately 40 hours\\n \\nbetween \\nDecember 16, 2019 through February \\n26, \\n2020.\\n \\n3.2\\n \\nAnalysis Type\\n \\nA condition analysis was performed using Revision 8.56 of the standardized plant analysis risk \\n(SPAR) model for North Anna Power Station (Unit 1 \\nand\\n \\nUnit 2) created in March 2019.  This \\nSPAR model includes the following hazards:\\n \\n\\n \\nInternal events,\\n \\n\\n \\nInternal f\\nloods,\\n \\n\\n \\nSeismic,\\n \\n\\n \\nHigh winds, and\\n \\n\\n \\nTornados.\\n \\n3.3\\n \\nSPAR\\n \\nModel Modifications\\n \\nThe following \\nmodification was made to the SPAR model for this analysis:\\n \\n\\n \\nCrediting FLEX Strategies\\n.  The probability of basic event FLX\\n-\\nXHE\\n-\\nXE\\n-\\nELAP \\n(\\noperators fail to declare ELAP when bene\\nficial\\n) was set to its nominal value of 10\\n-\\n2\\n \\nto \\nactivate the credit for FLEX mitigation strategies for postulated SBO scenarios for which \\nan extended loss of AC power (ELAP) is declared.\\n \\nLER 338\\n-\\n2020\\n-\\n001\\n \\n \\n3\\n \\n\\n \\nFLEX Reliability Parameters\\n.  FLEX hardware reliability parameters su\\nitable for inclusion \\nin the NRC SPAR models is not yet available.  Therefore, the base SPAR models \\ncurrently use the reliability parameters of permanently installed equipment, which is \\ninconsistent with the limited experience with the operation of FLEX equ\\nipment.  As part \\nof an NRC audit performed of preliminary FLEX hardware data provided by the \\n\\nreviewed the FLEX hardware parameters estimated by the PWROG.  This review \\nrevealed that\\n \\nFLEX diesel generator failure\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nstart (FTS) probability is 3 to 10\\n \\ntimes \\nhigher and failure\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nrun (FTR) rate is 2 to 5\\n \\ntimes higher than permanently installed \\nEDGs.  The portable engine\\n-\\ndriven centrifugal pump FTS probability is at least 8\\n \\ntimes \\nhigher \\nand FTR rate is at least 6\\n \\ntimes higher than permanently installed pumps.  See \\nTable\\n \\n1 in \\nINL/EXT\\n-\\n20\\n-\\n58327\\n\\n(ADAMS Accession No.\\n \\nML20155K834) for additional information.  Therefore, to provide \\na more representative estimate of the FLEX hardware reliability parameters, this \\nanalysis increased the hardware reliability by a factor of three in the best estimate case.\\n \\n\\n \\nRemoval of EDG Repa\\nir Credit for ELAP Scenarios\\n.  The base SPAR model provides \\ncredit for repair of postulated EDG \\nfailures for SBO scenarios.  However, this potential \\ncredit is not applicable for scenarios where ELAP will be declared because (a.) operators \\nwill be focused o\\nn implementing the FLEX mitigation strategies and (b.) the DC load \\nshedding activities could preclude recovery of EDGs.  Therefore, credit for EDG repair \\ncredit was removed from the sequences if it is included after ELAP is likely declared \\n(i.e.,\\n \\n1\\n \\nhour)\\n.\\n \\n\\n \\n72\\n-\\nHour AC Power Recovery Requirement\\n.  The base SPAR model requires AC power \\nrecovery within 72\\n \\nhours \\nfor a safe/stable end state for ELAP scenarios with successful \\nFLEX implementation.  If AC power is not recovered in these scenarios, the SPAR \\nmodels ass\\nume core damage.

F urther  investigation  revealed degradation of the number one upper piston pin bushing.     The apparent  cause was determined to be a degradation of the connecting rod aluminum cooling oil spherical  retainer ring which  resulted in increased oil flow and inadequate lubrication between the piston  pin and piston pin bushing .     The licensee i nvestigation concluded  that the   degradation   occurred  during the   previous  start of   EDG   1J    during  surveillance test ing   completed on January   22, 2020.   The previous successful test on EDG   1J    was completed on December   16 , 2019.     Repairs were  completed on   February   26 th   after successful post - maintenance  testing.     The total mean  core damage probability (  )   for this event is  5 ×10 - 6   and, therefore, this  event is a precursor.   This accident sequence precursor (ASP) analy si s reveals that the most  likely core damage  scenario  involve s a loss of offsite power (LOOP) initiating event   and  subsequent failure of all t he EDGs   resulting in station blackout (SBO )  along with  the  random   failure   or  unavailability  of the turbine - driven  auxiliary feedwater ( AFW )   pump and   failure of  operators to restore  alternating current ( AC )   power   within   1   hour .    Th is   accident  scenario   account s   for approximately  3 1    The risk  contribution from seismic events, internal floods, high winds, and tornados  is  minimal   for this  analysis .     N o  licensee  performance deficiency associated with this event  was   identified   by NRC  inspectors ; the LER is closed .  A n ASP analysis was  completed   because   a Significance  Determination Process (SDP)  risk  evaluation was not performed.   2   EVENT DETAILS      2.1   Event Description   On   February 18, 2020, the licensee discovered brass shavings in the upper crankcase of  EDG    the number one upper piston pin bushing.  The apparent cause was determined  to be a  degradation of the connecting rod aluminum cooling oil spherical retainer ring which resulted in  LER 338 - 2020 - 001     2   increased oil flow and inadequate lubrication between the piston pin and piston pin bushing.   The licensee investigation concluded that the degradation   occurred during the previous start of  EDG   1J    during surveillance testing completed on January   22, 2020.    The previous successful  test on EDG   1J    was completed on December   16, 2019.  Repairs were completed on  February   26 th   after successful post - maintenance testing.    Additional information is provided in  licensee event report (LER) 3 38 - 20 - 001  Degraded Upper Cylinder Piston Pin Bushing  Discovered during Maintenance Activities on Emergency Diesel Generator  No.   ML20122A056 ).   Cause.    Licensee investigation revealed that the failure of EDG   was caused by t he  degrad ation on number 1 upper cylinder piston pin bushing.   I nadequate lubrication between the  piston pin and bushing resulted from increased oil flow due to degradation of a connecting rod  cooling oil spherical retainer ring.   3   MODELING      3.1   SDP  Results/Basis for ASP Analysis   The ASP Program uses SDP results for degraded conditions when available (and applicable).   The   NRC  inspection of this event  is documented in  inspection report 05000338/2020003  Anna Power Station     Integrated Inspection Report 05000338/2020003 and 05000339/2020003   .   ML20310A166) .    The  inspectors determined that   licensee and, therefore, the technical specification (TS) violation was not a result of  deficient  licensee  performance   and was  addressed using tra  Enforcement Policy .   The LER is closed.   An independent ASP analysis was performed because  there was no   performance deficiency identified and , therefore, not SDP risk evaluation was  performed .     A search for windowed events revealed a concurrent unavailability  of  EDG    Specifically,  LER   338 - 20 - 001   st ates th at   EDG    for  surveillance testing and  maintenance for   approximately 40 hours   between  December 16, 2019 through February  26,  2020.   3.2   Analysis Type   A condition analysis was performed using Revision 8.56 of the standardized plant analysis risk  (SPAR) model for North Anna Power Station (Unit 1  and   Unit 2) created in March 2019.  This  SPAR model includes the following hazards:      Internal events,      Internal f loods,      Seismic,      High winds, and      Tornados.   3.3   SPAR   Model Modifications   The following  modification was made to the SPAR model for this analysis:      Crediting FLEX Strategies .  The probability of basic event FLX - XHE - XE - ELAP  ( operators fail to declare ELAP when bene ficial ) was set to its nominal value of 10 - 2   to  activate the credit for FLEX mitigation strategies for postulated SBO scenarios for which  an extended loss of AC power (ELAP) is declared.   LER 338 - 2020 - 001     3      FLEX Reliability Parameters .  FLEX hardware reliability parameters su itable for inclusion  in the NRC SPAR models is not yet available.  Therefore, the base SPAR models  currently use the reliability parameters of permanently installed equipment, which is  inconsistent with the limited experience with the operation of FLEX equ ipment.  As part  of an NRC audit performed of preliminary FLEX hardware data provided by the   reviewed the FLEX hardware parameters estimated by the PWROG.  This review  revealed that   FLEX diesel generator failure - to - start (FTS) probability is 3 to 10   times  higher and failure - to - run (FTR) rate is 2 to 5   times higher than permanently installed  EDGs.  The portable engine - driven centrifugal pump FTS probability is at least 8   times  higher  and FTR rate is at least 6   times higher than permanently installed pumps.  See  Table   1 in  INL/EXT - 20 - 58327  (ADAMS Accession No.   ML20155K834) for additional information.  Therefore, to provide  a more representative estimate of the FLEX hardware reliability parameters, this  analysis increased the hardware reliability by a factor of three in the best estimate case.      Removal of EDG Repa ir Credit for ELAP Scenarios .  The base SPAR model provides  credit for repair of postulated EDG  failures for SBO scenarios.  However, this potential  credit is not applicable for scenarios where ELAP will be declared because (a.) operators  will be focused o n implementing the FLEX mitigation strategies and (b.) the DC load  shedding activities could preclude recovery of EDGs.  Therefore, credit for EDG repair  credit was removed from the sequences if it is included after ELAP is likely declared  (i.e.,   1   hour) .      72 - Hour AC Power Recovery Requirement .  The base SPAR model requires AC power  recovery within 72   hours  for a safe/stable end state for ELAP scenarios with successful  FLEX implementation.  If AC power is not recovered in these scenarios, the SPAR  models ass ume core damage.  The American Society of Mechanical  Engineers/American Nuclear Society probabilistic risk assessment standard definition for  safe/stable end state does not require AC power recovery.  Because of the large  uncertainty in modeling assumption s related to availability and reliability of components  and strategies for mission times that are well beyond 24 hours and the unclear basis for  requiring AC power recovery within 72   hours, the 72 - hour AC power requirement was  eliminated in this analysis .    As part of this change, the FTR events for FLEX diesel  generators and pumps have a 72 - hour mission time in the base SPAR model.  These  mission times were reset to be consistent with the 24 - hour mission time used in the  SPAR model.   3.4   Exposure Time   Th e follow ing two exposure times were identified for this condition a nalysis :      Exposure  Time 1 .    The licensee concluded that the EDG   degradation occurred  during  its start as part of  surveillance testing completed on January 22, 2020 .     Repairs  were  completed on February   26 th   after successful post - maintenance testing.   Therefore,   36   days.   However, the failure mechanism could have occurred during any start of the EDG after  its   successful   surveillance test completed on December 16, 2019 , which is   an additional  37   days.   Therefore,   for  approximately  73   days .   E xposure time  1  is  calculated as 1712 hours (i.e.,  73 days  minus the 40 hours   from exposure time 2 ) .   LER 338 - 2020 - 001     4      Exposure Time 2 .    Based on the information provided in  LER 338 - 20 - 001 ,   EDG   was  inoperable for normal maintenance and surveillance activities for approximately  40   hours  between December 16, 2019 through February 26, 2020 .  Therefore, both EDGs are  assumed to be unavailable  for 40 hours in this exposure time.   3.5   Analysis Assumptions   T he following assumptions were determined to be significant to the modeling of this condition  assessment:      Basic event EPS - DGN - F S - DG1J ( EDG   1J  fail s   to  start )   was set to TRUE   for both  exposure times .      Basic event EPS - DGN - TM - DG1H   ( EDG 1H  unavailable due to  T&M )  was set to TRUE  for Exposure Time 2   only .   4   ANALYSIS RESULTS      4.1   Results   T he  mean    5 × 10 - 6 , which is the sum of both exposure  times.    The ASP Program threshold is  1× 10 - 6   for degraded conditions; therefore , this event is a  precursor .

The crediting of FLEX mitigation strategies has a  significant impact on these analysis results.   A sen sitivity analysis  assuming no credit for  FLEX   results in a   increase  by nearly a factor  of  four  (i.e., total mean   CDP of  2.3 ×10 - 5 ) .      Lack of Internal Fire   Scenarios   in the SPAR Model .  The   lack of internal fire s   scenario s   in the  North Anna   SPAR model   is a key uncertainty .  To address this uncertainty, the risk  information provided by the licensee for various risk - informed applic ations (e.g.,   TS   change)   was reviewed .   North Anna   references its individual plant examination for  external events (IPEEE)  for a quantitative assessment of the risk   associated with internal  fires   in their risk - informed licensing amendments to date .   Internal f ire scenarios that  c ould significantly impact for the risk of this event  would either  have to (a.)  impact the functionality of the   unaffected Unit   1 EDGs  or (b.)  result in a  LOOP event.   A rev iew of the   North Anna  IPEEE results  reveals that the  potential  fire  scenarios in the compartments containing   the  EDG s   and  the  fuel oil rooms were  screened without a detailed evaluation because a fire in these areas would not result in  LER 338 - 2020 - 001     6   a plant trip.   In add ition, potential  fire s   in one of these areas combined with the  known  unavailability of another EDG would require a controlled reactor shutdown   as directed by  TS .    Potential f ire scenarios  that could result in a  complete  LOOP   (offsite power to both  safety and nonsafety - related buses)   were not noted   in  IPEEE .   Given these  considerations,  it is not expected that  postulated  internal  fires   w ould substantially  increase the risk of th e   event   evaluated as part of this analysis .

Due to high RCS \\npressure as the result of the SI actuation, the pressurizer PORVs cycled \\nseven\\n times prior to \\noperator securing pressurizer spray and terminating SI.  \\nAdditional information is provided in \\nlicensee event report (L\\nER) 316-2020-002, ﬁManual Reactor Trip and Automatic Safety Injection \\nDue to Failed Open Pressurizer Spray Valve\\n,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML20311A129.\\n). 2.2 Cause\\n The licensee determined that the \\ncause of the failed \\npressurizer spray\\n valve was foreign \\nmaterial from the control air supply \\nbeing stuck \\nin the positioner spool\\n valve\\n. 3 MODELING \\n  3.1 SDP Results/Basis for ASP Analysis\\n The ASP Program performs independent anal\\nyses for initiating events. \\n ASP analyses of\\n initiating events account for all failures/degraded conditions and unavailabilities (e.g., equipment\\n \\nout for maintenance) that occurred during the event, regardless of licensee performance.\\n0F\\n1  No windowed \\nevents\\n were identified\\n. 3.2 Analysis Type\\n An initiating event analysis \\nwas performed using \\na test/limited use \\n(TLU) \\nstandardized plant \\nanalysis risk (SPAR) model for \\nD.C. Cook \\nNuclear Plant\\ns 1 and 2 created \\nin December \\n2020.  This \\nTLU model includes an \\ninadver\\ntent SI actuation \\nevent\\n tree to allow the modeling of this \\nevent\\n. 3.3 SPAR Model Modifications\\n The following SPAR model modifications were made to support this analysis:\\n  The event tree branch for th\\ne ISINJ (\\ninadvertent SI\\n) event tree was modified.  \\nSpecifically, the transfers to the \\nSLOCA (\\nsmall LOCA\\n) event tree were removed \\nand replace\\nd by branching within the parent event tree.\\n  These changes eliminate \\nunnecessary queries in the SLOCA event tree.  \\nIn addition, the\\n OEP (\\nconsequential loss \\nof offsite power\\n) top event\\n and transfer to the \\nLOOPPC (\\nplant\\n-centered loss of offsite \\npower\\n) event tree was inserted\\n to account for potential consequential LOOP during the \\nevent\\n.  The transfer for the failure of the reactor protection sys\\ntem sequence was \\n 1  ASP analyses also \\naccount for any degraded condition(s) that were identified after the initiating event occurred if\\n the failure/degradation exposure \\ntime\\n(s) overlapped the initiating event date.\\n LER \\n316-2020-003  3 changed\\n to the ATWS (\\nanticipated transient without scram\\n) event tree.  The modified \\nISINJ \\nevent tree is \\nprovided in \\nFigure\\n A-1 of Appendix\\n A.  Basic event \\nPPR-PRV\\n-CO-TRANS \\n(PORVs/SRVs open during \\ntransient\\n) was changed \\nto its complement\\n under gate PORV\\n-4 in the PORV (\\nPORVs are closed\\n) fault tree.\\n  This \\nchange \\nwas made to account for the pressurizer safety relief valves not being \\nchallenged if the PORVs lift during the SI actuation.\\n 3.4 Analysis\\n Assumpt\\nions The following modeling assumptions were determined to be significant to the modeling of this \\ninitiating \\nevent assessment:\\n  The probability of IE\\n-ISINJ\\n (inadvertent safety injection\\n) was set to 1.0 due to \\nautomatic \\nSI actuation\\n.  All other \\ninitiating event probabilities were set to zero.\\n  Basic event\\n PPR-PRV\\n-CO-TRANS \\nwas set to TRUE because the PORVs opened s\\neven\\n times during the event response.\\n  The pressurizer PORVs \\nexperience \\nseven\\n demands\\n due to high RCS pressure as a \\nresult of the SI a\\nctu\\nation.  T\\no account for the increased failure of these \\nPORVs\\n to successfully reclose after the opening, the associated failure probabilities were modified \\nusing binominal expansion to account for their greater likelihood of failure.  Basic event\\n ZT-PRV-OO-PZR-R1 (one pressurizer PORV fails to reclose after scram\\n) was\\n set to \\n1×10-2. 4 ANALYSIS RESULTS \\n  4.1 Results\\n The mean\\n CCDP \\nfor this analysis is calculated to be \\n1×10-5.  The ASP Program threshold \\nfor \\ninitiating events \\nis a CCDP of \\n10-6 or the \\nplant\\n-specific \\nCCDP of an uncomplicated reactor trip \\nwith a non\\n-recoverable loss of feedwater or the condenser heat sink, whichever is greater. \\n This \\nCCDP equivalent for \\nD.C. Cook Nuclear Plant\\n (Unit \\n2) is \\n4×10\\n-7.  Therefore, this event is a \\nprecursor\\n. The parameter uncertainty results \\nfor this analysis \\nprovided below:\\n Table \\n1.

While both of these HFEs use industry average HEP values \\nlike all SPAR \\nmodel HFEs, there is great\\ner uncertainty associated with \\nthe HEP for \\nHPI\\n-XHE\\n-XM-THRTL\\n because this event has not been evaluated in the same level of detail \\nas \\nrecirculation HFEs.\\n  The SPAR model HEP for \\nHPI\\n-XHE\\n-XM-THRTL\\n is \\n2×10-3.

As Reactor Coolant System (RCS) pressure reached 2235 psig, one of two Pressurizer Spray Valves began to dose as expected and the other valve traveled unexpectedly to the fully open position. The operators were unable to close the failed open valve.and manually tripped the reactor at 22:42 due to lowering RCS pressure. RCS pressure continued to lower below the safety injection (SI) actuation setpoint and an automatic SI occurred. All safety systems responded as expected and RCS pressure recovered to normal. The cause of the failed open valve was due to foreign material from the control air supply lodged in the positioner spool valve. The valve positioner and electro-pneumatic transmitter were replaced which returned the valve back into service. Planned corrective actions indude installing point of use filtration upstream of susceptible valve positioners or replace associated regulating valves to include a filter. This event was reported via Event Notification 54885 in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(A), 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2Xiv)(B), and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(rv)(A).

LERNJIIEER YEAR SEQUeITw.. 05000316 NUMBER 2020 -003 REV NO. -00 On September 4, 2020, Unit 2 was operating at 100 percent power. The Unit 2 control room operators were preparing to perform Main Turbine Stop and Control Valve [T AJM testing. At 16:06, the operators placed the initial set of Pressurizer Backup Heaters [PZR][EHTR] into service in preparation for a planned power reduction to support testing. After the heaters energized, the Pressurizer Spray Valve(s) [AB][FCV] 2-NRV-163 \"Reactor Coolant Loop '#3 to Pressurizer Spray Control Valve\" and 2-NRV-164 \"Reactor Coolant Loop #4 to Pressurizer Spray Control Valve\" were modulating to control pressurizer pressure. At 20:35, the operators began to lower reactor power in accordance with 2-OHP-4021-011-001, Attachment 2, Power Reductions Between 89 percent and 100 percent At 22:04, operators reported completing the planned power reduction and Unit 2 was stable at 92 percent reactor power. At 22:37, Pressurizer Spray Valves 2-NRV-163 and 2-NRV-164 closed together as expected in response to a lowering pressurizer pressure. At 22:38, both Pressurizer Spray Valves began to open upon a valid open signal. At 22:39, Reactor Coolant System (RCS) pressure reached 2235 psig and 2-NRV-163 began to close, as 2-NRV-164 continued to travel fully open. At 22:42, the control room received an annunciator, \"Pressurizer Pressure Low Deviation Backup Heaters On\" and discovered that 2-NRV-164 was fully open with zero percent demand. The operators entered procedure 2-0HP-4022-IFR-001, Instrument FaUure Response and determined that 2-NRV-164 could not be closed using control board or digital controls Alarm Log Panel controls. In accordance with procedure immediate actions, operators performed a manual trip of the Unit 2 Reactor [RCT]. The operators entered procedure 2-0HP-4023-E-O, Reactor Trip or Safety Injection. Reactor Coolant Pump(s) (RCP) [AB][P] 23 and 24 were removed from service following verification of E-0 immediate actions. Safety Injection (SI) automatically actuated after RCS pressure lowered below the setpoinl All automatic actions in response to the SI signal occurred as expected. Following the trip, Unit 2 was supplied by offsite power. AJI control rods fully inserted. The Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps [BA][P] started and operated, as expected. All Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) [BQ] components and Containment Isolation [8D] operated as required. Both Emergency Diesel Generators (EDG) [EK][DG] automatically started and remained in standby. Decay heat was removed by the Condenser Steam Dump Valves [SGJM and ECCS was secured.

NUMBER -003 REV NO. -00 During SI termination, RCP 22 was removed from service due to continued lowering RCS pressure caused by the failed open pressurizer spray valve 2-NRV-164. Afterward, RCS pressure recovered to normal pressure and remained stable. The event was reported via Event Notification 54885 in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(A), 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B), and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ivXA). The event is reportable as a Licensee Event \\nReport (LER) in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), for systems that resulted in a manual or automatic actuation of the R~ctor Protection System (RPS), Containment Isolation, Emergency Core Cooling (ECCS), Auxiliary Feec:twater System (AFW), and Emergency AC Electrical Power Systems. COMPONENT 2-NRV-164-PU, Reactor Coolant Loop #4 to Pressurizer Spray Control Valve 2-NRV-164 Pneumatic Positioner [AB][PC] CAUSE OF THE EVENT Pressurizer spray valve 2-NRV-164 failed open due to debris lodged In the positioner spool valve. No point of use filtration was installed upstream of the spray valve positioner to protect from debris generation downstream of the control air after filter [LF][FL l]. A Root Cause Evaluation (RCE) was in progress at the time this LER was submitted. Any additional insights or causes found to be substantively different as descnbed in this LER will be reported in a supplement at that time. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Completed Corrective Actions The valve positioner and electro-pneumatic transmitter for 2-NRV-164 was replaced. Satisfactory diagnostic testing of 2-NRV-164 was completed which returned the valve back into service. Planned Corrective Actions Install point of use control air filtration or associated regulating valve with a filter upstream of single point vulnerable valve positioners susceptible to binding caused by small particulate.

The potential nuclear safety significance and consequences could have been more severe had the operators not responded as they did or if any of the safety features had not functioned property. INDUSTRIAL SAFETY There was no actual or potential industrial safety hazard resulting from 2-NRV-164 failing open. RADIOLOGICAL SAFETY There was no actual or potential radiological safety hazard resulting from 2-NRV-164 failing open. PROBABILISTIC RISK ASSESSMENT A Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) was completed. The safety significance of the event was derived by calculating the Conditional Core Damage Probability (CCDP) and the Conditional Large Earty Release Probability (CLERP) of the transient initiating event, with the current site Full-Power Internal Events PRA Model of Record. The assessment concluded that the event was of very low safety significance.

The EDG\\ns did not \\nimmediately \\nenergize\\n their respective safety buses beca\\nuse offsite power remained available.  \\nHowever, approximately \\n14 minutes later, \\na loss of \\noffsite power\\n (LOOP)\\n occurred that resulted \\nin a reactor trip.  The output breakers for both EDGs automatically closed to reenergize the \\nsafety buses. \\n The licensee d\\neclared a\\nn Unusual Event.  All control rods successfully inserted.  \\nReactor inventory control was maintained by reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) and the \\nsafety relief valves (SRVs) were used to remove decay heat to the torus.\\n The high winds resulted in minor damage to \\nthe \\nreactor, turbine, and FLEX building\\ns, along with \\nmore severe damage to the nonsafety\\n-related cooling towers.  \\nThe licensee later determined \\nthat, although damaged, secondary containment remained functional thr\\noughout the event and \\nif challenged, would have prevented a radiological release to the environment.  However, when \\n\\ntested, the vacuum drawn in secondary containment by the standby gas treatment system was \\nslightly below the technical specification\\n (TS)\\n limit.\\n In addition, t\\nhe high winds result\\ned in increase\\nd debris loading to the essential service water \\n(ESW) system, which cause\\nd clogging of the train\\n ‚B™ strainer\\n and subsequent decrease of ESW \\nflow of 300\\n gpm to EDG\\n ‚B™\\n.  Operators successfully bypassed t\\nhe strainer\\n.  The train ‚A™ \\nstrainer was also challenged due to debris during the event; however, the differential pressure \\n\\nacross the strainer reached a maximum of 11\\n psid, which is below the limit of 15\\n psid and, \\ntherefore,\\n did not require to be bypassed\\n.  Although the operators declared\\n EDG ‚B™ \\ninoperable\\n according to TS, i\\nt did not experience any problems due to the use of unstrained ESW\\n and ran \\nsuccessfully through\\nout the event\\n.  Operators restored offsite power to the safety buses \\napproximately 25\\n hours after the LOOP \\noccurred\\n. This accident sequence precursor (ASP) analysis reveals that the most likely core damage \\nsequence is a \\nweather\\n-related \\nLOOP initiating event and the subsequent \\n(postulated) \\nfailure of \\nboth EDGs resulting in a station blackout \\n(SBO)\\n with the postulated failure\\ns of both \\nhigh\\n-pressure coolant injection (\\nHPCI\\n) and RCIC and \\nthe \\ninability of \\noperators \\nto \\nrecover alternating \\ncurrent (AC) \\npower \\nwithin 30\\n minutes\\n.  This accident seque\\nnce accounts for approximately \\n35 percent of the total conditional core damage probability (CCDP) for this event.\\n  Although the \\nLER 331\\n-2020-001   2 mean \\nCCDP \\nof \\n8×10\\n-4 for this event \\nwas high\\n, the risk \\nof core damage was mitigated\\n because \\ndefense\\n-in-depth and plant\\n-wide safet\\ny margins were maintained.\\n FLEX mitigation strategies were credited in this analysis\\n and significantly \\naffected the results.  \\nSpecifically, \\nwithout \\nthe mitigation capabilities of the \\nFLEX strategies \\nwould have \\nresult\\ned in a \\nCCDP approximately\\n a factor of \\n10 higher for \\nthis event\\n.  Throughout the review\\n of this event\\n, the analysis \\nassumptions and\\n results were systematically review\\ned to identify necessary \\nstandardized plant analysis risk (\\nSPAR) model changes \\nthat \\nwere \\nimplemented\\n to realisticall\\ny represent the event \\nand expected plant response.  In addition, \\nanalysis \\nresults were al\\nso use\\nd to identify key sources of uncertainty\\n. The risk of this event was significantly impacted by the \\nSBO scenarios. \\n The risk associated with \\nthe SBO scenarios is \\nparticularly high for this plant because\\n of having \\nonly two \\nsafety\\n-related \\nEDGs\\n and \\nthe in\\nability to crosstie safety\\n-related buses\\n from another unit\\n as Duane Arnold is a \\nsingle unit site\\n. 2 EVENT DETAILS \\n  2.1\\n Event Description\\n On August\\n 10, 2020, \\nsevere thunder\\nstorms and high winds caused a grid \\nperturbation that \\nresulted in an automatic start of both \\nEDGs.\\n  The EDG did not immediately \\nenergize\\n their \\nrespective safety buses because\\n offsite power remained available.  However, approximately \\n14 minutes later, \\na LOOP occurred resulting\\n in a reactor trip.  The output breakers for both \\nEDGs automatically closed to reenergize the safety buses.\\n The licensee declared \\nan Unusual \\nEvent\\n.  All control rods successfully inserted.  Reactor inventory control was maintained by\\n RCIC and the SRVs were used to remove decay heat to the torus.\\n The high winds resulted in minor damage to \\nthe \\nreactor, turbine, and FLEX building\\ns, along with \\nmore severe damage to the nonsafety\\n-related cooling towers.  \\nThe licensee later determined \\nthat, although damaged, secondary containment remained functional throughout the event and \\nif challenged, would have prevented a radiological release to the environment.  However, when \\ntested, the vacuum drawn in secondary con\\ntainment by the standby gas treatment system was \\nslightly below the \\nTS limit.\\n In addition, t\\nhe high winds result\\ned in increase\\nd debris loading to the ESW system, which \\ncause\\nd complete \\nclogging of the train\\n ‚B™ strainer\\n and subsequent\\n decrease of ESW flow o\\nf 300 gpm to EDG\\n ‚B™\\n.  Operators successfully bypassed the strainer\\n.  The train ‚A™ strainer was \\nalso challenged due to debris during the event; however, the differential pressure across the \\nstrainer reached a maximum of 11\\n psid, which is below the \\nlimit of 15\\n psid\\n and, therefore, did \\nnot require to be bypassed\\n.  Although the operators declared\\n EDG\\n ‚B™ \\ninoperable according to \\nTS, it\\n did not experience any problems due to the use of unstrained ESW\\n and ran successfully \\nthroughout the event\\n.  Operators \\nrestored offsite power to the safety buses approximately 25 \\nhours after the LOOP \\noccurred\\n.

The main steam isolation valves (MSIVs) remained open throughout the event.  During \\nmost LOOPs, the MSIVs will close due to the loss\\n of power from the reactor protection \\nsystem (RPS) motor generators.  However, the starting of the EDGs due to the grid \\n\\nperturbation prior to the LOOP allowed for a faster reenergization of the safety \\nbuses \\nprior\\n to the voltage from RPS motor generators \\ndecre\\nasing \\nbelow the value that would \\nresult in a loss of power to the MSIVs.  Because the MSIVs remained open, operators \\naligned the main steam line\\n (MSL)\\n drains\\n to the condenser\\n, which \\nminimized the number \\nof demands on the reactor \\nSRVs \\n(two SRVs each cycled \\nopen and closed one \\ntime\\n).  The current SPAR models use a failure\\n-to-close probability for SRVs of 9.6×10\\n-2 taken \\nfrom \\nNUREG\\n-1150, ﬁSevere Accident Risks: An Assessment for Five U.S. \\nNuclear \\nPower Plants\\n,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML120960691)\\n.  This probability \\naccounts for \\nmultiple SRV demands\\n; therefore, this probability was not changed given the two \\ndemands experienced during the event and the expected additional demands during a \\npostu\\nlated SBO in which the MSIVs would close.\\n  NUREG/CR\\n-7037, ﬁIndustry \\nPerformance of Relief Valves at U.S. Commercial Nuclear Power Plants through 2007,ﬂ\\n (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML110980205\\n) has an\\n updated reliability estimate; however, the \\nLER 331\\n-2020-001   4 adequacy of SRV testing that is included in these estimates has come into question.  \\nSpecifically, \\ntesting is \\nperformed \\nto demonstrate that the SRVs will open to relieve \\npressure during design\\n-basis accidents to \\nprevent overpressure of the reactor coolant \\nsystem.  However, the closing capability \\nof SRVs \\nis not tested \\nafter passing \\nsteam\\n.  In \\naddition, there \\nare\\n concerns about the demand data used in the stuck\\n-open SRV \\nprobability provided in \\nNUREG/CR\\n-7037.  The probability taken from \\nNUREG\\n-1150 is \\npotentially\\n conservative\\n; however, t\\nhe effect of the stuck\\n-open SRV probability on this \\nanaly\\nsis is largely mitigated by the credit of the di\\nesel\\n-driven firewater pump and FLEX \\nRPV makeup pumps for these scenarios\\n.  During the event, the running spent fuel pool (SFP) cooling pump ‚A™ tripped.  Operators \\nimmediately started SFP cooling pump ‚B™.\\n  Prior to the event, the licensee was loading fuel into a spent fuel canister. \\n These fuel \\nmoves were stopped prior to the storms affecting the site; the fuel and canister were \\nplace\\nd in a safe condition within the SFP.\\n  On August 12, a small \\ntear\\n was discov\\nered in the \\n5th floor wall of the r\\neactor \\nbuilding\\n that \\nwas the result of storm damage. \\n A subsequent \\ntest of the \\nsecondary \\ncontainment \\nboundary \\nidentified that the vacuum of \\n0.24 inches of water\\n was \\nless that the t\\nechnical \\nspecification \\nrequirement \\nof 0.25 inches of water. \\n At the time of discovery, the plant was\\n is in Mode 4, which does not require s\\necondary \\ncontainment \\nto be operable\\n.  However, \\nit \\nis very likely that \\nthe \\ntear\\n in the \\nreactor \\nbuilding wall likely existed \\nwhile the \\nplant wa\\ns in \\nMode 3\\n after the \\nreactor scram and, therefore, se\\ncondary \\ncontainment \\nwas inoperable \\nduring this period\\n.  Although considered inoperable, the licensee determined that a \\nvacuum of \\n0.24 inches of water was sufficient to \\nmaintain \\nthe safety function of \\nsecondary containment\\n. 3 MODELING \\n  3.1\\n Basis for ASP Analysis\\n The ASP Program performs independent analyses for initiating events.  ASP analyses of \\ninitiating events account for all failures/d\\negraded conditions and unavailabilities (e.g., equipment \\nout for maintenance) that occurred during the event, regardless of licensee performance.\\n1  Additional LERs were reviewed to determine if concurrent unavailabilities existed during the \\nAugust\\n 10th eve\\nnt.  No windowed events were identified.\\n The plant and licensee response to this event was evaluated by NRC inspectors \\nas \\ndocumented \\nin \\ninspection report 05000331/2020003\\n, ﬁDuane Arnold Energy Center \\nŒ Integrated Inspection \\nReport\\n 05000331/2020003 \\nand 07200032/2020001\\n,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML20314A150\\n).  \\nInspectors evaluated th\\ne licensee's immediate and follow\\n-up corrective\\n actions to this event. \\n The inspectors \\nalso \\ndetermined that all equipment\\n responded as expected with \\na few \\nexceptions\\n (e.g., \\nloss of spent fuel\\n pool cooling\\n), and operators followed appropriate\\n response \\nproce\\ndures. \\n The inspectors determined that the licensee's corrective actions to\\n address this \\ncomplex event were appropriate to the circumstances and commensurate with\\n the potential \\nsafety significance.\\n  No findings or violations of more than minor significance\\n were identified.\\n  1  ASP analyses also account for any degraded condition(s) that were identified after the initiating event occurred if\\n the failure/degradation exposure \\ntime\\n(s) overlapped the initiating event date.\\n LER 331\\n-2020-001   5 3.2\\n Analysis Type\\n An initiating event analysis \\nwas performed using \\nRevision\\n 8.56\\n of the \\nSPAR model for \\nDuane \\nArnold Energy Center\\n created \\nin June\\n 2019.  This event was modeled as a \\nweather\\n-related\\n LOOP initiating event.\\n 3.3\\n SPAR Model \\nModifications\\n The following modifications were required for this initiating event analysis:\\n  Crediting FLEX Strategies\\n.  The probability of basic event FLX\\n-XHE\\n-XE-ELAP \\n(operators fail to declare ELAP when beneficial\\n) was set to its nominal value of 10\\n-2 to \\nactivate the credit for FLEX mitigation strategies for postulated SBO scenarios for which \\nan extended loss of AC power (ELAP) is declared.\\n2  FLEX Reliability Parameters\\n.  FLEX \\nhardware reliability \\nparameters suitable for inclusion \\nin the NRC SPAR models \\nis \\nnot yet\\n available.  Therefore, \\nthe \\nbase \\nSPAR model\\ns currently \\nuse the reliability\\n parameters\\n of permanently installed equipment\\n, which is\\n inconsistent with the limited experience with \\nthe operation of \\nFLEX\\n equipment\\n.  As part \\nof \\nan NRC audit \\nperformed \\nof p\\nreliminary FLEX \\nhardware data provided by the \\nPressurized Water Reactor Owner™s Group (PWROG)\\n, Idaho National Laboratory\\n reviewed the FLEX hardware parameter\\ns estimated by the PWROG\\n.  This review \\nrevealed that \\nFLEX diesel generator failure\\n-to-start\\n (FTS)\\n probability \\nis 3 to 10\\n times \\nhigher\\n and failure\\n-to-run\\n (FTR)\\n rate is \\n2 to 5\\n times \\nhigher than permanently installed \\nEDGs\\n.  The portable \\nengine\\n-driven\\n centrifugal pump FTS\\n probability\\n is \\nat least \\n8 times \\nhigher\\n and FTR rate \\nis \\nat least \\n6 times \\nhigher than permanently installed pumps\\n.  See \\nTable\\n 1 in \\nINL/EXT\\n-20-58327\\n, ﬁEvaluation of Weakly Informed Priors for FLEX Data\\n,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML20155K834)\\n for addition\\nal information.\\n  Therefore, t\\no provide \\na more representative\\n estimate of the FLEX \\nhardware r\\neliability\\n parameters, this \\nanalysi\\ns increased the hardware reliability \\nby a \\nfactor of \\nthree \\nin the best estimate case\\n.  The use of th\\ne FLEX hardware \\nmultiplier\\n is a key \\nmodeling\\n uncertainty\\n and is evaluated \\nfurther \\nin Section 4.3\\n.  Removal of EDG Repair Credit for ELAP Scenarios\\n.  The base SPAR model provides \\ncredit for repair of postulated EDG \\nfailures for SBO scen\\narios.  However, this potential \\ncredit is not applicable for scenarios where ELAP will be declared because (a.) operators \\n\\nwill be focused on implementing the FLEX mitigation strategies and (b.) the DC load \\nshedding activities could preclude recovery of EDG\\ns.  Therefore, credit for EDG repair \\ncredit was removed from the sequences if it is included after ELAP is likely declared \\n\\n(i.e.,\\n 1 hour)\\n via a change set containing the applicable EDG repair basic events\\n.  HPCI Credit\\n During ELAP Scenarios.\\n  The \\nbase SPAR model does not credit FLEX for \\nscenarios where RCIC is failed, but HPCI \\nis available\\n.  This assumption is likely \\nconservative and, therefore, \\nFLEX \\ncredit was\\n applied \\nby \\nmodifying the SBO event tree \\nby transferring the\\n SBO Sequence\\n 6 to the SBO ELAP event tree (see Figure\\n A-2 in \\nAppendix\\n A).  Most of the\\n FLEX information\\n available\\n, including \\nthermal\\n-hydraulic \\ncalcu\\nlations\\n, is focused on RCIC\\n performance and do\\nes not consider HPCI as an \\n 2  After the \\nDerecho storm had passed\\n the site, the licensee had the capability to pre\\n-stage FLEX equipment.  \\nHowever, after \\ndiscussing this possibility, the decision was made to\\n not move any \\nFLEX equipment.\\n LER 331\\n-2020-001   6 alternative high\\n-pressure injection source.\\n  Therefore, this \\nchange\\n is potentially \\nnonconservative.\\n  SBO-ELAP Event Tree Modification\\n.  The SBO\\n-ELAP event tree was modified to include \\nthe query of containment venting in scenarios when reactor depressurization fails.  \\nThe \\nmodified SBO\\n-ELAP event tree is provided in\\n Figure B\\n-1 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  Additional Mitigat\\nion Credit for Stuck\\n-Open SRV Scenarios\\n.  MELCOR calculations were \\nperformed to determine timing information \\nfor postulated stuck\\n-open SRV scenarios.  \\nSpecifically, the\\n time until RCIC/HPCI\\n isolation on low steam pressure (75 psig) and \\ntimes to core uncovery/damage\\n were calculated\\n.  Based on these calculations, the \\nRCIC \\nor HPCI would isolate on low steam pressure \\nin approximately 90\\n minutes given a single \\nstuck\\n-open SRV.  Core damage \\nis estim\\nated to occur \\nbetween\\n 4Œ6 hours.\\n  For \\ntwo \\nstuck\\n-open SRVs, \\nRCIC\\n/HPCI\\n would isolate in less than 1\\n hour and core d\\namage would \\noccur \\nin \\napproximately \\n90 minutes.  \\nDiscussions with the licensee revealed\\n that \\noperators\\n would have \\nenough\\n time to connect and initiate either firewater or FLEX \\nreactor \\npressure vessel (RPV) \\nmakeup\\n, which is not credited in the base SPAR model.  \\nTo provide this \\ncredit\\n, the \\napplicable sequences \\nwere transferred to the SBO\\n-ELAP \\nevent tree.\\n  In addition, offsite power recovery times for the SBO\\n-1 and SBO\\n-2 event \\ntrees were changed to \\n3 hours and 1\\n hour, respectively\\n, based on MELCOR calculation \\nestimates.\\n3  These modified event trees are provide\\nd in Figure\\ns B-2 and B\\n-3 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  72-Hour AC Power Recovery Requirement\\n.  The base SPAR model requires AC power \\nrecovery within 72\\n hours \\nfor a safe/stable end state for ELAP scenarios with successful \\nFLEX implementation.  If AC power is not recovered \\nin these scenarios, the SPAR \\nmodels assume core damage.  The American Society of Mechanical \\nEngineers/American Nuclear Society (ASME/ANS) probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) \\nstandard definition for safe/stable end state does not require AC power recovery. \\n Because of the large uncertainty in modeling assumptions related to availability and \\nreliability of components and strategies for mission times that are well beyond 24\\n hours \\nand the unclear basis for requiring AC power recovery within 72\\n hours, the 72\\n-hour AC \\npower requirement was eliminated in this analysis by inserting a new basic event, OPR\\n-72HR\\n-OFF (\\nno 72-hr OPR requirement\\n), under the top event in the OPR\\n-72H fault tree \\nand setting it to FALSE.  This change is considered a key modeling uncertainty for\\n this \\nanalysis.  This modified fault tree is provided in Figure\\n B-4 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  As part of this \\nchange, the FTR events for FLEX diesel generators and pumps have a 72\\n-hour mission \\ntime in the base SPAR model.  These mission \\ntimes were reset to be consistent with the \\n24-hour mission time used in the SPAR model.\\n  Credit for \\nTechnical Support Center (TSC) Diesel Generator\\n.  The SBO\\n-ELAP event tree \\ncurrent\\nly credits \\nthe \\nFLEX \\n480-volt (V) diesel generators\\n in the FLEX\\n-480 fault tree.  \\nHowever, \\nthe plant has \\nan additional \\nTSC diesel generator that can al\\nso charge the \\nsafety\\n-related batteries\\n.  Therefore, the FLEX\\n-480 fault tree was modified by inserting \\nthe existing\\n DG-TSC\\n fault tree and changing the existing gate structure\\n to ensure both \\nthe FLEX and TSC diesel generators a\\nre \\npotentially \\navailable to provide \\nbattery \\ncharging\\n.  The two human failure events (HFEs)\\n FLX\\n-XHE\\n-XM-480 (\\noperators fail to \\n 3  The associated \\nEDG repair times were also changed.  \\nHowever, this change does not affect this analysis\\n because EDG repair is not credited after ELAP is declared.\\n LER 331\\n-2020-001   7 stage or run or load or refuel 480V portable flex diesel\\n) and\\n EPS-XHE\\n-XM-TSC \\n(operator action to align TSC DG to battery chargers\\n) are treated as completely \\ndependent in the SPAR model post\\n-processing rules\\n.  This modified fault tree is \\nprovided in Figure\\n B-5 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  Credit for Firewater\\n Pump\\n.  The SBO\\n-ELAP event tree current\\nly credits FLEX RPV \\nmakeup\\n in the FLEX\\n-RPV fault tree.  However, \\nfirewater is not currently credited.\\n  Therefore, the \\nFLEX\\n-RPV fault tree \\nwas modified by inserting \\nthe \\nexisting \\nFWS fault tree\\n and changing the existing gate structure \\nto ensure both\\n firewater and the FLEX RPV \\nmakeup pumps are available to provide reactor inventory makeup.  \\nIn the FWS \\nfault \\ntree, t\\nhe human error probability (HEP) for existing \\nHFE FWS\\n-XHE\\n-XM-ERRLT \\n(operator fails \\nto align firewater injection\\n) was set to a screening value\\n 0.1\\n.4  In addition, \\nFWS\\n-XHE\\n-XM-ERRLT\\n and existing basic event FWS\\n-EDP\\n-TM1P49 (\\ndiesel fire pump is \\nunavailable because of maintenance\\n) were \\nmoved under a new ‚AND™ gate because the \\nfirewater pump \\nwas undergoing maintenance \\nat the onset of the event; however, \\noperators could clear the maintenance tags to restore the pump within 1 hour, if needed\\n.  The two HFEs \\nFWS\\n-XHE\\n-XM-ERRLT and \\nFLX-XHE\\n-XM-RPV\\n (operators fail to stage or \\nrun or supply or refill FLEX RPV pump\\n) are treated as completely dependent in the \\nSPAR model post\\n-processing rules.  \\nThis modified fault tree\\ns are\\n provided in \\nFigure\\ns B-6 and B-7 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  Use of Environmental Common\\n-Cause\\n Failure (CCF)\\n Parameters for ESW Strainers\\n.  To \\nimprove \\nthe realism in the \\nmodel\\ning of\\n potential \\nCCF\\n of the \\nESW \\nstrainers due to the \\nincreased debris loading experienced during the event,\\n the alpha factors for ESW \\nstrainers were modified to those of environmental events (instead of all causes)\\n, which \\nare more representative \\nof the conditions experienced during the event\\n.  Specifically,\\n the \\nalpha factors ZA\\n-STR\\n-PG-SWS\\n-02A01 \\n(alpha factor 1 \\nin group size 2 for component \\nSTR with failure mode PG:SWS\\n) and ZA\\n-STR\\n-PG-SWS\\n-02A02 (\\nalpha factor 2 in group \\nsize 2 for component STR with failure mode PG:SWS\\n) were changed from their nominal \\nvalues to 0.874 and 0.126,\\n respectively\\n.5  Credit for Ability to \\nBypass Clogged ESW Strainers\\n.  The ability for operators to bypass \\nthe clogged ESW strainers\\n is not included in the base SPAR model.  To provide this \\ncredit\\n, new fault trees ESW\\n-STRAINER\\n-A (ESW pump A discharge strainer plugs\\n) and \\nESW STRAINER\\n-B (ESW pump \\nA discharge strainer plugs\\n) were created\\n.  These two \\nnew fault trees include the existing strainer independent failure and CCF basic events \\nalong with new \\nHFE\\n ESW\\n-XHE\\n-XM-BYPASS (\\noperators fail to bypass plugged strainer\\n), \\nwhich credits the ability of operators to bypass a clogged ESW strainer.  \\nThese new fault \\ntrees are provided in Figures\\n B-6 and B\\n-7 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  ESW-XHE\\n-XM-BYPASS was \\nevaluated using \\nNUREG/CR\\n-6883, ﬁThe SPAR H Human Reliability Analysis Method,ﬂ \\n(ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML051950061).  The HEP for ESW\\n-XHE\\n-XM-BYPASS was \\ncalculated to be 1×10\\n-3; see Appendix\\n C for additional information\\n.  Fault tree ESW\\n-STRAINER\\n-A was inserted as a transfer tree in fault trees ESW\\n-A and ESW\\n-DGN\\n-A to \\nsubstitute for the existing strainer independent failure and CCF basic events.  Likewise, \\n 4  NUREG\\n-1792, ﬁGood Practices for Implementing Human Reliability \\nAnalysis,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession \\nNo.\\n ML051160213) provides that 0.1 is an appropriate screening (i.e., typically conservative) value for most post\\n-initiator HFEs.\\n 5  These alpha factor changes also affect the residual heat removal (RHR) service water heat syste\\nm strainers.  \\nThe RHR service water system takes its suction of the same pit as ESW.\\n LER 331\\n-2020-001   8 fault tree ESW\\n-STRAINER\\n-B was inserted in fault trees ESW\\n-B and ESW\\n-DGN\\n-B.  \\nThese modified \\nfault\\n trees are provided in Figures\\n B-8 through B\\n-13 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  Reactor Water Level Control During \\na LOOP\\n.  The existing \\nHFEs for reactor water level \\ncontrol using RCIC (\\nRCI-XHE\\n-XO-ERROR, \\nRCI-XHE\\n-XM-OPERATE\\n, RCI\\n-XHE\\n-XM-OPERATE2\\n) and/or HPCI (\\nHCI-XHE\\n-XO-ERROR, \\nHCI-XHE\\n-XO-ERROR1\\n) were not \\nevaluated \\nto \\naccount for the \\nprocedures directing operators to bypass the \\nhigh\\n reactor \\nwater level (Level 8) pump \\ntrips\\n, raise reactor wat\\ner level\\n, and control level in a\\n relatively \\nnarrow (\\n10-inch\\n) band when \\nforced circulation is lost\\n.  With the pump trips bypas\\nsed, a \\nfailure to control level could result in flooding the pump turbines \\nresulting in a loss of \\nboth high\\n-pressure injection systems\\n.  To better represent this action, a new ba\\nsic event \\nRCS-XHE\\n-XM-LEVEL (\\noperators fail to control reactor water level duri\\nng loss of forced \\ncirculation\\n) was inserted in the applicable fault trees\\n (HCI, HCI01, HCI02, RCI, RCI01, \\nRCI02, FLX\\n-TDP, FLX\\n-TDP\\n2) to replace the existing HFEs\\n for \\nLOOP scenarios\\n.  The HFE RCS\\n-XHE\\n-XM-LEVEL was evaluated using IDHEAS\\n-ECA methodology because \\nthe performance shaping factors \\n(PSF\\ns) of \\nthe \\nSPAR\\n-H method \\ndo not represent control \\nactions very well.\\n  The HEP for \\nRCS-XHE\\n-XM-LEVEL\\n was calculated to be \\n2×10\\n-2; see \\nAppendix\\n C for additional informati\\non.  SPAR Model Quantification Issues\\n.  A review of preliminary analysis results identified \\nsome \\nSPAR model quantifications issues that required \\nchanges.  First, t\\nhe component \\nID was deleted from basic event FWS\\n-EDP\\n-TM-1P49 (\\ndiesel fire pump is \\nunavailable \\nbecause of maintenance\\n) because it was causing calculation errors.\\n  Second, \\nsome \\nevent tree linkage rules were added to the SBO event tree. \\n These rules substituted in \\ninitiator specific \\npower recovery logic to facilitate more accurate calculat\\nion of success \\npath cut sets.\\n 3.4\\n Analysis\\n Assumptions\\n The following modeling assumptions were \\nrequired to reflect the plant status and event \\ncircumstances \\nfor\\n this initiating event assessment\\n:  The probability of IE\\n-LOOP\\nWR (loss of offsite power (\\nweather\\n-related\\n)) was set to 1.0 \\ndue to the loss of offsite power. \\n All other initiating event probabilities were set to zero.\\n  Basic event ESW\\n-STR\\n-PG-PDISB (\\nESW pump B discharge strainer 1S\\n-89B plugs\\n) was \\nset to TRUE due to ESW train ‚B™ strainer becoming \\nclogged during the event.\\n  Basic event FWS\\n-EDP\\n-TM-1P49\\n was set to \\nTRUE\\n because th\\ne pump was undergoing \\nmaintenance during the event.  All other test and maintenance probabilities were kept at \\ntheir nominal values.\\n  Offsite power was recovered to \\nthe \\nsafety buses approximately 25 hours after the LOOP \\noccurred\\n.  Based\\n on the event information and \\ndiscussions with \\nRegion\\n 3 inspectors, \\nit \\nwas determined that offsite\\n power could have been restored \\nto the safety buses \\nshortly \\nafter the\\n Vinton offsite power line was restor\\ned approximately 23 hours \\nafter\\n the LOOP \\noccurred\\n.  Therefore, basic events OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR30M\\nWR (operators fail to recover \\noffsite power in 30 minutes\\n), OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR01HWR (\\noperators fail to recover offsite \\npower in 1 hour\\n), OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR05HWR (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in 5 \\nhours\\n), OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR08HWR (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in 8 hours\\n), \\nOEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR10HWR (\\noperators fail to\\n recover offsite power in 10 hours\\n), \\nand \\nOEP\\n-LER 331\\n-2020-001   9 XHE\\n-XL-NR012HWR (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in 12 hours\\n) were set \\nTRUE.\\n  The HEP for b\\nasic event \\nOEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR024HWR (\\noperators fail to recover \\noffsite power in 24 hours\\n) was \\ncalculated\\n to be 2×10\\n-3; see \\nAppendix\\n C for additional \\ninformation\\n.  Both\\n control rod drive (CRD) pumps were impacted by using the \\nMSL\\n drains to the \\ncondenser for cooldown.  The operating CRD pump developed a seal leak\\n and was \\nsecured\\n.  In addition, operators manually started the standby pump\\n when \\nit became \\nvapor bound \\ndue to \\nthe \\nhigh \\nsuction \\nwater \\ntemperature.\\n  Therefore, basic events \\nCRD-MDP\\n-FR-A (CRD pump A fails to run\\n) and CRD\\n-MDP\\n-FS-B (CRD pump B fails to start\\n) were set to TRUE.\\n  This modeling assumption is potentially conservative; however, the \\nnonrecoverable failure of the CRD system results in negligible risk contribution for th\\nis \\nanalysis.\\n 4 ANALYSIS RESULTS \\n  4.1\\n Preliminary \\nResults\\n The mean\\n CCDP for this analysis is \\npreliminarily \\ncalculated to be \\n8×10\\n-4.  The ASP Program \\nthreshold for initiating events is a CCDP of 10\\n-6 or the \\nplant\\n-specific \\nCCDP of an uncomplicated \\nreactor trip \\nwith a non\\n-recoverable loss of feed water or the condenser heat sink, whichever is \\ngreater.

The results of any sensitivity \\nanalyses \\nperformed to \\nevaluate these uncertainties are provided in \\nTable\\n 4.  The Amount of Credit for \\nFLEX \\nMitigation Strategies\\n.  The credit\\ning of FLEX mitigation \\nstrategies has as significant impact on these analysis results\\n.  A sensitivity analysis \\nyields \\nan increase in \\nCCDP\\n of \\napproximately a factor of 10\\n with\\nout\\n FLEX credit.\\n  While \\ncredit is appropriate, it is important to note that th\\nere \\nare considerable un\\ncertainties\\n (as \\ndiscussed below)\\n associated with \\nvarious aspects of \\nFLEX modeling.\\n  HPCI Credit During ELAP Scenarios.\\n  The base SPAR model does not credit FLEX for \\nscenarios where RCIC is failed, but HPCI \\nis available.  This assumption is likely \\nconservative and, therefore, FLEX credit was applied by modifying the SBO event tree\\n.  Most of the FLEX information available, \\nincluding thermal\\n-hydraulic calcu\\nlations, is \\nfocused on RCIC performance and does not consider HPCI as an alternative high\\n-pressure injection source.  \\nBecause \\nthe use of\\n FLEX \\nin scenarios that only HPCI is \\navailable has not been analyzed, \\ncrediting \\nFLEX in\\n such \\nscenarios may\\n be unrealistic \\nand may \\noverestimate\\n the \\nrisk re\\nduction \\nachieved by crediting FLEX\\n.  A sensitivity \\nanalysi\\ns yields a\\nn increase in \\nCCDP of \\napproximately \\n120 percent \\nwithout FLEX credit\\n for scenarios where HPCI is successful and RCIC is un\\navailable/failed\\n.  FLEX Hardware Reliability\\n.  As previously mentioned, \\nhardware reliabilit\\nies\\n for FLEX \\nequipment \\nare\\n not \\ncurrently available and, therefore, the SPAR model uses the reliability \\nof permanently installed equipment\\n, which is \\nconsidered nonconservative\\n.  Based on \\npreliminary data received from the PWROG, failure probabilities and rates for FLEX \\ndiesel generators and engine\\n-driven centrifugal pump\\ns are \\n2 to \\n10 times \\nmore \\nlikely to \\nfail \\nthan \\npermanently installed \\nequipment\\n.  Ther\\nefore, \\nsensitivity analyses were \\nperformed using the multiplier range \\nof 2 to 10 times that of permanently installed \\nequipment\\n.  These sensitivity \\nanalyses yield a decrease in CCDP of \\n3 percent for a \\nmultiplier of 2 and an increase in CCDP of approximately\\n 18 percent \\nand\\n 57 percent\\n for \\nmultipliers of 5 and 10\\n, respectively\\n.

An \\nauxiliary operator (AO) was sent in accordance with the \\n\\nalarm response procedure. When the operator arrived, the \\nESW train ‚B™ strainer differential pressure reached 15\\n psid \\nand was directed by the main control room operators to \\nbypass the strainer. This was completed within 15\\n minutes. \\nTherefore, the nominal t\\nime for this HFE is assumed to be \\n5 minutes for diagnosis and 10\\n minutes for action.\\n  Although ESW train ‚B™ flow to its respective EDG had \\ndecreased dropped from 1100 to 800\\n gpm, operators did not \\nobserve any degradation in EDG ‚B™ performance. It is \\nbeli\\neved that strainer debris loading peaked at this level (as \\nindicated by the ESW train ‚A™ not increasing after reaching \\n11 psid even though its strainer was not bypassed). It is \\npossible that EDG ‚B™ would have continued to run \\nsatisfactorily with the plug\\nged strainer with a differential \\npressure of 15\\n psid. For this event assessment, it is assumed \\nthat operators would have approximately 1\\n hour to bypass \\nthe strainer, which is could be potential conservative. Since \\n\\nthe 1\\n hour available for diagnosis is grea\\nter than 2× nominal \\ntime and greater than 30\\n minutes, the diagnosis PSF for \\navailable time is set to Expansive.\\n  Enough time exists to perform the action component for this \\noperator action; therefore, the action PSF for available time is \\nset\\n to Nominal\\n.

We understand that the decision to credit HPCI averted undue \\nconservatism.  The decision to credit HPCI \\nwas researched and even informed by \\nthermal\\n-hydraulic analysis.  We believe this approach to increase realism of the PRA \\nanalysis is a strength.\\n  NRR, Section 3.3:\\n We noted that the analysis adjusted the portable FLEX equipment to a \\n24-hour mission time to \\nestimate \\nFTR probability. \\n While we understand a 72\\n-hour mission \\ntime would be overly conservative, would a 24\\n-hour mission time be potentially non\\n-conservative? \\n However, since the analysis has identified failure probabilities of FLEX \\nequipment as a key u\\nncertainty and performed appropriate sensitivity analysis, we do not \\nconsider this observation as a substantive comment.\\n  NRR, Section 4.1:\\n The use of a mean value rather than a point estimate is acceptable and \\nsupported by references such as NUREG\\n-1489, an\\nd NUREG\\n-1855.\\n D.2\\n Comments Requiring Response or Change\\n  Region 3, Executive Summary:\\n The \\nExecutive Summary\\n states the following\\n: ﬁAlthough \\nthe preliminary mean CCDP of 1\\n×10-3 for this event currently meets the criterion for a \\nsignificant precursor, the risk to the public remained very low because defense in depth and \\nplant\\n-wide safety margins were maintained.ﬂ  This sentence is simultaneously describing the \\nrisk as both high a\\nnd low.  In the interest of clarity and consistency of our message about \\nthe high safety significance of this issue, consider changing the wording.  One possible \\nalternative would be: ﬁthe risk of core damage was mitigated because defense in depth and \\nplan\\nt-wide safety margins were maintained.ﬂ\\n RES Response/Action:\\n The suggested change \\nwas\\n implemented in the final report\\n.

Recall that the \\n‚B™ train \\nESW \\nstrainer reached 15\\n psid and required bypassing due to debri\\ns loading. \\n The ‚A™ train strainer reached 11\\n psid and did not require bypassing but represented a potential \\nchallenge or a ﬁnear miss.ﬂ  This challenge to both trains of \\nESW \\nis one of the main drivers \\nof the high \\nCCDP \\nand the reason that the LIC\\n-504 effor\\nt was started.  Consider adding \\nthese insights in the \\nExecutive Summary\\n and the \\nEvent Description\\n that describes how both \\nservice water \\ntrains were simultaneously \\naffected\\n.  This would have the benefit of\\n  (a.)\\n increas\\ning\\n transparency for those reading the ASP analysis and \\n(b) provide a better \\ntechnical basis for adjustment of the \\ncommon\\n-cause failure alpha factors described in \\nSection\\n 3.3\\n. RES Response/Action:\\n A description of the challenge to the train ‚A™ ESW strainer \\nwas\\n added to the \\nExecutive Summary\\n and \\nSection 2.1\\n of the final report\\n.  Region 3, \\nExecutive Summary and Section 2.1\\n: Considered changing the following \\nsentence: ﬁThe licensee later determined that damage to the reactor building resulted in the \\nsecondary containment being inoperable according to TS due to i\\nnsufficient vacuum.ﬂ  \\nSuggested replacement: ﬁThe licensee later determined that, although damaged, secondary \\n\\ncontainment remained functional throughout the event and if challenged, would have \\nprevented a radiological release to the environment.  However, \\nwhen tested, the vacuum \\n\\ndrawn in secondary containment by the standby gas treatment system was slightly below \\nthe very conservative technical specification limit.ﬂ\\n RES Response/Action:\\n The suggested change \\nwas\\n implemented in the final report\\n.  Region 3, \\nSection 2.1\\n: The control rod drive (\\nCRD\\n) pumps were impacted by using the \\nmain steam line drains to the condenser for cooldown.  The operating CRD pump developed \\n\\na seal leak.  The standby pump was started, and th\\ne pump became vapor bound due to the \\nhigh temperature at the suction of the pump.  Consider whether the report should discuss \\nthis impact and model as appropriate given that CRD is a BWR alternate injection source for \\nlate injection.  While this condition \\nwould not impact the current dominant sequences, it \\ncould impact other LOOP core damage sequences.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n The degradation of both CRD pumps \\nwas\\n modeled explicitly in the \\nanalysis and documented in the final report (\\nSection\\n 3.4\\n).  Note that this change has a \\nnegligible effect on the result because four additional systems (ESW, residual heat removal \\n\\nservice water, firewater, and general service water) are credited for late injection during a \\nLOOP.\\n  Region \\n3, \\nSection 2.\\n2: Consider deleting the following sentence:\\n ﬁThe event was not \\nconsidered a beyond design basis eventﬂ.

However, after \\ndiscussing this possibility, the decision was made to not move any FLEX equipment\\n.ﬂ  NRR, Section 3.3:\\n We noted that the analysi\\ns adjusted the portable FLEX equipment to a \\n24-hour mission time to estimate \\nFTR probability. \\n While we understand a 72\\n-hour mission \\ntime would be overly conservative, would a 24\\n-hour mission time be potentially non\\n-conservative? \\n However, since the analysis has identified failure probabilities of FLEX \\nequipment as a key uncertainty and performed appropriate sensitivity analysis, we do not \\n\\nconsider this observation as a substantive\\n comment.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n We believe that\\n if the applicable FLEX strategies are fulfilling their \\nsafety function at 24\\n-hours, we believe that is sufficient to declare safe/stable end state.\\n  NRR, \\nSection 3.3:\\n We understand the decision to remove the cr\\nedit for EDG repair during \\nELAP scenarios.  Our comment would be that this is appropriate to do on a case\\n-by-case \\nbasis, it would be useful to show a sensitivity showing how much of an effect this had on the \\nresults.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n A sensitivity case\\n crediting\\n EDG repair for ELAP scenario \\nestimates a mean CCDP \\n6×10-4 (a decrease of approximately \\n20 percent).  \\nThe issue of \\ncrediting EDG repair in the base SPAR models could be reconsidered.  \\nIt is\\n a typical SPAR \\nmodel practice to not credit strategies n\\not included in the licensee PRAs\\n, yet less than a \\nthird \\nof licensee PRAs include credit for EDG repair\\n.  In addition\\n, the nonrecovery \\nprobabilities are calculated by INL using data extracted from unplanned unavailability times \\nfrom MSPI (typically normal operations with only a single EDG to troubleshoot).  During the \\nLER 331\\n-2020-001   D-4 Level 3 PRA project, industry peer review members questi\\noned the basis for crediting repair \\nof the EDGs, which had been adopted from the SPAR models.  Subsequently, it was \\ndecided to remove EDG repair from the Level 3 PRA because the staff questioned whether \\nrepair data collected under normal conditions is appl\\nicable to SBO scenarios where \\nconditions may be different (e.g., reduce\\nd lighting, increased stress, staffing constraints) and \\nthere would be multiple EDG failures to troubleshoot.  Although there could also be factors \\n(e.g., increased priority, eliminatio\\nn of restrictive licensee processes) that reduce the repair \\ntime.\\n  NextEra, Section 3.4:\\n The preliminary \\nASP analysis \\nused the timeline that was developed \\nfor the \\nLER\\n to note that power was not restored to the safety buses from an offsite power \\nsource until\\n twenty\\n-five hours after the LOOP occurred1. \\n However, the Vinton 161\\n-kV line \\nwas restored as a power source at 11:26. \\n As the plant was in a safe and stable \\nconfiguration the ensuing period was taken up with coordinating a deliberate and \\nuninterrupted tra\\nnsfer of power from the \\nEDGs\\n to the offsite power supply. \\n Had an \\nEDG\\n failed at any point after 11:26, offsite power was available to re\\n-energize emergency busses. \\nTherefore, offsite power was available to be restored to the safety buses approximately \\n22.6\\n hours after the event started and not 25 hours.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n Based on this comment and subsequent discussion with Region\\n 3 inspectors, we agree that credit for offsite power recovery at 24\\n hours should be provided.  \\nThe applicable text in the Anal\\nysis Assumptions (\\nSection\\n 3.4\\n) has been revised.  This \\nchange results in the mean CCDP decreasing from 1\\n×10-3 to 8\\n×10-4. D.3\\n Comments Concerning Base SPAR Model Considerations\\n  NextEra:\\n The SPAR model\\ns utilize generic data out of the NRC Reactor Operating \\nExperience Database. \\n The PWR\\nOG recently reviewed the component reliability data and \\nidentified that the \\nFTR data used in the SPAR models is potentially over\\n-estimating the \\nprobability of diesel failur\\nes. \\n The PWROG\\n, when reviewing this data, showed that the rate \\nfor diesel generators \\nFTR\\n could be reduced from 1.\\n4×10\\n-3 per hour to 8.4\\n×10\\n-4 per hour.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n This data issue, along with others previously reported \\nin PWROG\\n-18026-P, ﬁComponent \\nReliability Data Issues and Strategies\\n,ﬂ \\nis currently being reviewed by \\nthe NRC and INL.  \\nIn the interim, INL performed a revised calculation \\nfor the EDG FTR rate \\nusing data from \\nthe \\n2010Œ2019 period and \\nconsistent with\\n existing Institute of Nuclear \\nPower Operations (INPO) guidance. \\n This calculation resulted in \\nmean failure rate of \\n1.32\\n×10-3 per hour (\\n103 failures in 82,768 hours)\\n.  Note that the number of run hours from \\nfailures to load/run (FTLR) failure mode (i.e., f\\nailures to run within 1 hour) is not deducted \\nfrom the run hours in the FTR failure mode in the above calculation.\\n  This revised\\n failure rate \\nis only 1\\n3 percent\\n lower than the current EDG FTR rate of 1.52\\n×10-3 per hour.\\n  Since this \\nrevised\\n rate\\n is within a reasonable uncertainty range \\nof the FTR rate used in the analysis \\nand is not expected to make a significant impact on the overall CCDP\\n, the ED\\nG FTR rate \\nwas not changed in the best estimate case.\\n  NextEra:\\n The preliminary \\nASP analysis \\nassume\\ns that\\n core damage would occur without \\naccounting for the specific failure modes that were present in the cut\\n sets. \\n The most \\nsignificant conservatism was that \\nFTR events\\n (e.g., EDG or RCIC)\\n, were assumed to occur \\nat the start of the event\\n (i.e., t \\n= 0).  Howeve\\nr, this failure mode does not align with the \\ngeneric SPAR data as a\\nn FTR \\nevent is noted as occurring after the first hour and up to \\nLER 331\\n-2020-001   D-5 24 hours. \\n Incorporating this time dependence would allow for additional credit for FLEX \\nmitigation strategies.\\n RES Response\\n/Action:\\n The treatment of FTR events in the SPAR models is consistent \\nwith the current state\\n-of-practice.  \\nThe assumption that failures occur at the start of the event \\nis in part addressed by applying factors related to convolution of EDG FTR \\nevents.\\n  However, this convolution credit does not \\nmeaningfully \\naffect the analysis for this event \\nlargely due to \\nthe \\nlong time (~23 hours) until offsite power could be recovered.  It is \\nrecognized that this treatment is conservative, but the proper treatm\\nent of FTR failure would \\nlikely require aspects of ﬁdynamicﬂ PRA, which is beyond the scope of this analysis.\\n  NRR, Section 3.3:\\n We agree with the basis to eliminate the 72\\n-hour AC power recovery \\nrequirement since that assumption introduces an unnecessary conservatism.  This raises an \\nissue in the opinion of at least this analyst that we should follow\\n-up on.  Should we consider \\neli\\nminating this conservatism from SPAR models to enhance their accuracy after further \\ndiscussions among cognizant stakeholders (NRR\\n\\DRA, RES\\n\\DRA, SRAs, and INL staff)?\\n RES Response/Action:\\n This issue will be discussed with internal stakeholders to determine \\nif there is a consensus opinion\\n to eliminate the 72\\n-hour AC power recovery requirement\\n in \\nall SPAR models\\n.  Region 3, Section 3.3:\\n HPCI credit during ELAP and SBO\\n-ELAP event tree changes to \\nquery containment venting if reactor depressurization fails.  If th\\nese model changes are \\napplied for this event, they should be made to other BWR SPAR models.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n RES\\n will consider\\n similar SPAR model modifications\\n to applicable \\nplants\\n, as appro\\npriate\\n.</td>\n",

An Unusual Event was declared at 1258. All Safety Systems performed as designed. As a result of the LOOP, the 'A' and 'B' Emergency Diesel Generators automatically started and supplied power to the safety related busses. As a result, the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) automatically initiated and injected into the reactor. In addition, containment isolations occurred, as expected for this event. This resulted in a 4-hour event report to the NRC under 10 CFR 50.72 section 50.72{b)(2)(iv)(A) -ECCS Injection, 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) -RPS Actuation -Critical, 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) -Valid Specific System Actuation (reference EN#54826). The NOUE was exited at 1600 on August 11, 2020. The cause of the LOOP was an extremely severe storm (called a Derecho) with heavy rains and very high winds. This event had no impact on public health or safety. There were no systems, structures, or components inoperable at the time of the event that contributed to the event. This I event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50. 73(a)(2)(iv)(A), 50. 73(a)(2)(v)(C) and 50. 73(a)(2)(iii). There were no radiological releases associated with this event.

LER NUMBER SEQUENTIAL NUMBER -001 REV NO. -01 On August 10, 2020, at 1246 CDT, while operating at 80% power, NextEra Energy Duane Arnold· (DAEC) experienced a Generator Load reject and subsequent reactor scram as a result of a loss of offsite power (LOOP) due to extremely high winds. An Unusual Event was declared at 1258. All Safety Systems performed as designed. As a result of the LOOP, the 'A' and 'B' Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs) automatically started and supplied power to the safety related busses. In response to the expected Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) level transient, the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) automatically started and injected. In addition, containment isolations occurred, as expected for this event. This resulted in a 4-hour event report to the NRC under 10 CFR 50. 72 section 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(A) -ECCS Injection, 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) -RPS Actuation -Critical, 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) -Valid Specific System Actuation (reference EN#54826). The cause of the LOOP was an extremely severe storm ( called a Derecho) with heavy rains and very high winds. This event had no impact on public health or safety. There were no systems, structures, or components inoperable at the time of the event that contributed to the event. The Unusual Event was exited at 1600 on August 11, 2020. IL Assessment of Safety Consequences: In response to the LOOP, the plant experienced a Generator Lockout, Turbine Trip and Reactor Scram. The operating crew entered the appropriate emergency procedures. The EDG's quickly re-energized tlie safety-related electrical busses and restored power. The Reactor Protection System (RPS) power was never lost as the EDG's were able to recover power to the essential buses quickly. This prevented a Main Steam Isolation Valve (MSIV) isolation signal and thus allowed the Main Condenser to remain available post event. As expected for this event, RPV level dropped below L2 setpoint (119.5\") initiating the HPCI and RCIC systems. Reactor level recovered quickly. The Low Low Set System functioned as designed initially opening two primary system relief valves to control reactor pressure.

LER NUMBER SEQUENTIAL NUMBER -001 Operators were quickly able to establish pressure control initially via Steam Line Drains and RCIC and establish a cooldown rate. Both recirculating pumps tripped when power was lost to their associated non-safety related electrical busses. The operators followed procedures for cooldown with no forced circulation in the core. When Shutdown Cooling was placed in service, forced circulation was re-established which resulted in exceeding the bottom head cooldown limits of 100 degrees per hour. This was anticipated and could not be avoided. On August 12, a small cut was discovered in the Reactor Building 5th floor wall that was the result of storm damage. A test of the Secondary Containment boundary was conducted to determine the effect of the cut. The vacuum able to be drawn on secondary containment with one train of Standby Gas Treatment.System (SGTS) was 0.24 inches of water. The vacuum required to be drawn by Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement is 0.25 inches of water. Secondary Containment was declared inoperable with the plant not in the mode of applicability (Mode 4, Cold Shutdown). During a review of past operability of Secondary Containment, it was determined that the cut in the Reactor Building wall likely existed during the period the plant was cooling down in Mode 3, Hot Shutdown. Secondary Containment is required to be operable in Mode 3. DAEC design basis \\ndocuments state the design safety criteria for SGTS is to \"limit exfiltration from the secondary containment during periods of primary and/or secondary containment isolation\" and \"to control outward leakage of the atmosphere from the secondary containment\". Therefore, the safety function of SGTS and Secondary Containment was maintained by the ability to draw a substantial vacuum of 0.24 inches of water with the cut in the Reactor Building wall. Although the safety function of Secondary Containment and SGTS was maintained throughout this event, the reporting criteria in NUREG-1022 for 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C) states\" ... a report is required when 1) there is a determination that the SSC is inoperable in a required mode or other specified condition, 2) the inoperability is due to ... equipment failures ... , and 3) no redundant equipment in the same system was operable.\" Since Secondary Containment was declared inoperable, it meets the reporting criteria outlined in NUREG-1022. This event did not result in a Safety System Functional Failure.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER Duane Arnold Energy Center 05000-331 Ill. Cause of Event: YEAR 2020 3. LERNUMBER SEQUENTIAL NUMBER -001 The cause of the LOOP was an extremely severe storm (called a Derecho) with heavy rains and very high winds. Wind speeds exceeded 80 mph for over 20 minutes with peaks on site at greater than 100 mph. The National Weather Service later estimated wind speeds were likely near 130 mph. These winds resulted in all 6 off site power sources (4 -161 kV and 2 -\\n345 kV) coming into the DAEC switchyard being damaged or downed. A separate offsite 69 kV line which feeds non-essential plant loads was also damaged. IV. Corrective Actions: REV NO. -01 The high winds experienced on August 10, 2020 were not considered a beyond design basis event. The systems and components responded as designed and the overall peak wind speeds were within the Design Basis Tornado. The damage observed coincides with the amount of damage expected for the event. Given this event was outside the control of the station staff and that all components worked as designed, no additional corrective actions beyond repair/recovery efforts related to the wind storm are needed.

Additional information is provided in \\nlicensee event report (L\\nER) 325-2020-002, ﬁAutomatic Specified System Actuations due to Loss \\nof Offsite Power\\n,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML20265A162\\n). 2.2 Cause\\n The licensee determined that the \\nelectrical fault that \\nresulted \\nin \\nthe transformer bus powering \\nthe SAT to trip and\\n the subsequent LOOP was \\ncaused \\nstorm\\n-generated debris from\\n Hurricane \\nIsaias\\n. 3 MODELING \\n  3.1 SDP Results/Basis for ASP Analysis\\n The ASP Program performs independent analyses for initiating events. \\n ASP analyses of\\n initiating events account for all failures/degraded conditions and unavailabilities (e.g., equipment\\n \\nout for maintenance) th\\nat occurred during the event, regardless of licensee performance.\\n2 Additional LERs were reviewed to determine if concurrent unavailabilities existed during the\\n August 3\\nrd event. \\n No windowed events were identified.\\n  Discussions with Region 2 staff indicate\\n that no licensee performance deficienc\\ny associated with this event ha\\ns been identified; \\nhowever, the LER remains open.\\n 3.2 Analysis Type\\n An initiating event analysis \\nwas performed using \\nRevision\\n 9.33 of the standardized plant \\nanalysis risk (SPAR) model for \\nBrunswick Steam Electric Plant\\n (Unit\\n 1) created on \\nJuly\\n 31, 2020.  This event was modeled as a switchyard\\n-centered LOOP initiating event.\\n  1  The Unit 2 EDGs started but did not load onto their respective safety buses because they remained energized \\nvia offsite power throughout the event.\\n 2  ASP analyses also account for any degraded condition(s) that were identified after the initiating event occurred if\\n the failure/degradation exposure \\ntime\\n(s) overlapped the initiating event date.\\n LER \\n325-2020-003  3 3.3 SPAR Model Modifications\\n No SPAR model modifications were needed for\\n this analysis.\\n 3.4 Analysis\\n Assumptions\\n The following modeling assumptions were determined to be significant to the modeling of this \\ninitiating \\nevent assessment:\\n  The probability of IE\\n-LOOPSC (\\nloss of offsite power (switchyard\\n-centered)\\n) was set to \\n1.0 due to the loss of offsite power. \\n All other initiating event probabilities were set to \\nzero.\\n  Basic event OEP\\n-VCF\\n-LP-SITESC (\\nsite LOOP (switchyard\\n-centered)\\n) was set to FALSE \\nbecause the event was single unit LOOP.\\n  The probability of basic event FLX\\n-XHE\\n-XM-ELAP (\\noperators fail to declare \\nELAP\\n when \\nbeneficial\\n) was set to \\nit nominal \\nvalue of 1\\n×10-2 to activate the credit for FLEX mitigation \\nstrategies for SBO scenarios for which an extended loss of AC power (ELAP) is \\ndeclared.  Sensitivity analyses show that \\nthe amount of FLEX credit \\nhas a \\nminimal\\n impact on the\\n analysis\\n results.\\n  Offsite power was restored \\nto the two safety buses via the SAT in approximately 15 and \\n17 hours, respectively\\n.  It is believed that operators could have restored offsite power \\nmore quic\\nkly if postulated\\n SBO had occurred.  However, \\nan exact determination on \\nwhen \\nthe offsite\\n power\\n could have been restored is not available\\n.  Given this uncertainty, \\nbasic event\\ns OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR30MSC (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in \\n30 minutes\\n) and OEP-XHE\\n-XL-NR0\\n2HSC (operators fail to recover offsite power in \\n2 hours) were\\n set to TRUE. \\n Although this assumption is potential\\nly conservative, \\nsensitivity analyses show \\ncredit for \\nthe \\noffsite power recovery \\nhas a \\nminimal impact\\n on the analysis results.\\n 4 ANALYSIS RESULTS \\n  4.1 Results\\n The mean\\n CCDP \\nfor this analysis is calculated to be \\n2.0×10-5.  The ASP Program threshold \\nfor \\ninitiating events \\nis a CCDP of \\n10-6 or the \\nplant\\n-specific \\nCCDP of an uncomplicated reactor trip \\nwith a non\\n-recoverable loss of feed water or the condenser heat sink, whichever is greater. \\n This \\nCCDP equivalent for \\nBrunswick Steam Electric \\nPlant (Unit \\n1) is \\n1.5×10-5.

By design, \\nall Main Steam Isolation Valves closed and an \\nautomatic reactor scram occurred. All contro\\nl rods inserted as expected on the scram.\\n At the time of this event the main generator \\nwas removed from service due to unrelated ge\\nnerator ground issues and all plant loads\\n were \\nbeing supplied by the SAT. \\nBy design, the LOOP resulted in automatic \\nactuation of Primary Containm\\nent Isolation System (PCIS) \\nGroup 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 isol\\nation \\nvalves. In addition, all four emergency diesel generators (EDGs)\\n started, with EDGs 1 and 2 loadin\\ng to their respective emergen\\ncy buses per design. Reactor water level reached low level 1 followi\\nng the scram resulting in automat\\nic actuation of PCIS Groups 2\\n, 6, and 8, by design. \\nThe electrical fault that caused the transformer bus powering \\nthe SAT to trip and subsequent LOOP was determined to be a result\\n of storm generated debris. \\nThere was no impact on the health and safety of the public or \\nplant personnel. This event is being reported in accordance with \\n 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to valid actuation of\\n the Reactor Protection System, PCIS, and EDGs. \\n(See Page 3 for required number of digits/characters for each block) \\n(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form \\nhttp://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/\\n)  NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION \\n(08-2020) \\n LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) \\n CONTINUATION SHEET \\n(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form \\nhttp://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/\\n) APPROVED BY OMB:  NO. 3150-0104 EXPIRES:  08/31/2023 \\n Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

Unit 2\\n was in Mode 1 (i.e., Power Operation), at approx\\nimately 100 percent rated thermal power.  \\n Reportability Criteria \\n \\nThis event is being reported in accordanc\\ne with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A\\n) because it involved actuat\\nion of systems listed in  \\n10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). Specifically, the \\nReactor Protection System (RPS) [JC], Prim\\nary Containment Isolat\\nion System (PCIS) \\n[JM], and the Emergency Diesel Generators (EDG\\ns) [EK] actuated during this event.   \\n Per 10 CFR 50.72(a)(1)(i), the NRC was notified of an Unusual Ev\\nent (UE) being declared via Event Notification 54812 at 23:31 \\nEastern Daylight Time (EDT) on August 3,\\n 2020. The NRC was notified of the RPS [JC]\\n actuation while critical and the valid \\nspecified system actuations per \\n10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv\\n)(A), respectively, via an update to Event \\nNotification 54812 at 01:20 EDT on August 4, 2020.   \\n Event Description \\n \\nAt 23:02 EDT on August 3, 2020, \\nwith Unit 1 in Mode 1 at approximately 19% \\npower during Hurricane Isaias, a loss of the \\ntransformer bus powering the Startup Auxiliary Transformer (SAT) [EA] resulted in a Loss of Offsite Power (LOOP). By design, al\\nl Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIVs) [JM] closed and an automati\\nc reactor scram occurred. All c\\nontrol rods inserted as expected \\non the scram.   At the time of this event the main genera\\ntor was removed from service and all plant loads were being supplied by the SAT. Power\\n had been lowered to 19% prior to the event in preparation for \\nshutting down for maintenance associated with unrelated generator\\n ground issues.  \\n By design, the LOOP resulted in automatic\\n actuation of Primary Contai\\nnment Isolation System (PCIS)\\n Group 1 (i.e., main steam), \\nGroup 2 (i.e., floor and equipment drain), Group 3 (i.e., reac\\ntor water cleanup), Group 6 (i.e., monitoring and sampling), and \\nGroup 8 (i.e., shutdown cooling) isolation valves. In addition, all four \\nemergency diesel generators (EDG\\ns) started, with EDGs 1 and 2 loading to their respective emergency buses per design. Reacto\\nr water level reached low level 1 following the scram resulting i\\nn automatic actuation of PCIS Gr\\noups 2, 6, and 8, by design. \\n At 23:12 EDT on August 3, 2020, Unit 1 dec\\nlared a UE due to the LOOP. The UE wa\\ns exited at 14:54 on August 4, 2020.  \\n Event Cause \\n \\nExtensive investigation and testi\\nng concluded that the electrical \\nfault that caused the transformer bus powering the SAT to tri\\np and subsequent LOOP was not a result of an equi\\npment failure. The fault was determined to \\nbe a result of storm generated debris fro\\nm Hurricane Isaias.  \\n Safety Assessment \\n There was no adverse impact on the health and \\nsafety of the public. The safety significa\\nnce of this event is minimal. The autom\\natic reactor trip was as expected, and all safety related systems operated as designed. \\n     NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION \\n(08-2020) \\n LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) \\n CONTINUATION SHEET \\n(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form \\nhttp://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/\\n) APPROVED BY OMB:  NO. 3150-0104 EXPIRES:  08/31/2023 \\n Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (FitzPatrick).  As \\ndescribed in the subject inspection report, the NRC determined that this finding involved \\napparent violations of Title 10 of the \\nCode of Federal Regulations\\n (10 CFR) Part 50, \\nAppendix B, Criterion XV, ﬁNonconforming Materials, Parts, or Componentsﬂ and Criterion VII, \\nﬁControl of Purchased Material, Equipment, and Services.ﬂ  The receipt and use of the defective \\npart at FitzPatrick resulted in a failure of the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) system on \\nApril 10, 2020.\\nConsequently, ExGenalso violated FitzPatrick Technical Specification \\n(TS) 3.5.1, since the HPCI system was determined to be inoperable for greater than the TS \\nallowed outage time.   \\nIn a letter dated February 26, 2021 (ML21057A190), ExGen™s Mr. Pat Navin, FitzPatrick Site \\nVice President, provided a written response that acknowledged the circumstances that led to \\nthe use of the defective part at FitzPatrick.  However, in the response, ExGen also:  \\n(1)described Exelon™s business services group (which handled the part at Limerick and\\n\\nFitzPatrick) as being a separate corporate entity that works only under the specific facility\\nlicense at which the staff are physically located and disagreed the Criterion XV violation\\nrepresented a failure that was within FitzPatrick™s ability to foresee and prevent; (2) maintained\\nthat FitzPatrick™s receipt inspection of the parts was performed in accordance with Criterion VII\\nand other regulatory and self-imposed requirements; and (3) provided information and insights\\nrelated to the NRC™s preliminary characterization of the finding as being of low-to-moderate\\n1 Designation in parentheses refers to an Agency-wide Documents Access and Management System \\n(ADAMS) accession number.  Documents referenced in this letter are publicly-available using the \\naccession number in ADAMS. \\nD. Rhoades 2 \\n   (White) safety significance and stated that the significance of this finding could potentially be \\nbelow the threshold for a White determination.   \\n\\n In the February 26, 2021, letter, ExGen also indicated that the NRC™s description of the \\nCriterion VII apparent violation should be analyzed as a backfit under 10 CFR Part 50.109, \\nﬁBackfitting.ﬂ  On March 3, 2021, Mr. Daniel Collins, Director, Division of Reactor Projects and \\nMr. Eric D. Miller, Senior Resident Inspector, of my staff participated in a telephone call with \\nExGen™s Mr. Navin and Ms. Adriene Smith, FitzPatrick Director of Organizational Performance \\nand Regulatory Affairs, to obtain clarification on whether ExGen was requesting to enter the \\nbackfit appeal process described in NRC Management Directive 8.4, ﬁManagement of \\nBackfitting, Forward Fitting, Issue Finality, and Information Requests.ﬂ  Mr. Navin and Ms. Smith \\n\\nclarified during the call that ExGen was not requesting to enter the backfit appeal process at this \\n\\ntime but may choose to formally contest the violations or seek formal review of backfit concerns \\nafter the final significance determination is issued.  Therefore, the NRC evaluated the remaining \\nitems in ExGen™s February 26, 2021, letter.  A summary of ExGen™s positions as provided in its \\n\\nletter, the NRC™s response to the points raised by ExGen, and the details of the NRC™s \\nconclusion on the safety significance of this issue, are provided in Enclosure 1. \\n \\nAfter careful consideration of the information developed during the inspection and the additional \\ninformation provided in ExGen™s February 26, 2021, letter, the NRC staff has clarified the finding \\nand has concluded that the finding is appropriately characterized as White, a finding of low to \\n\\nmoderate safety significance.  The NRC staff has also determined that the finding involved \\n\\nviolations of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion VII, Criterion XV, and TS 3.5.1, and has \\nrevised those violations.  Our considerations in reaching these determinations included that: \\n1) the duration of the finding and violations should be changed from 2010 to 2017 in order to \\n\\nmore clearly focus on the time period in which Fitzpatrick had become part of the ExGen Fleet; \\n2) the NRC™s Enforcement Policy holds licensees accountable for the actions of their \\nemployees, contractors and vendors, and, therefore, the information in ExGen™s response \\n\\nregarding ExGen™s corporate structure and internal work practices (i.e. roles and responsib\\nilities \\nof ﬁbuyersﬂ and ﬁsellersﬂ) would not impact the assignment of this regulatory and enforcement \\naction to Fitzpatrick; and, 3) our review of the additional information provided relative to the risk \\nfor this finding did not materially impact our assessment.  In fact, a more comprehensive \\nanalysis of some of the information provided may have actually resulted in an overall increase in \\nour risk assessment.  It should be noted that the violations are strictly focused on compliance \\nwith 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, but should not be viewed as limiting or impacting any of your \\n\\ninternal practices as long as the applicable underlying regulatory requirements are satisfied. \\n The revised finding is provided in Enclosure 2.  You have 30 calendar days from the date of this \\n\\nletter to appeal the NRC staff™s determination of significance for the identified White finding. \\n\\nSuch appeals will be considered to have merit only if they meet the criteria given in the NRC \\nInspection Manual Chapter 0609, Attachment 2, ﬁProcess for Appealing NRC Characterization \\nof Inspection Findings (SDP Appeal Process),ﬂ effective January 25, 2021.  An appeal must be \\nsent in writing to the Regional Administrator, Region I, 2100 Renaissance Boulevard, Suite 100, \\nKing of Prussia, PA 19406. \\n \\nThe revised violations are cited in the Notice of Violation (Notice), provided as Enclosure 3. \\nBecause the violations are related, they have been categorized collectively as an enforcement \\nproblem, which is a way of documenting violations that share a common factor (i.e., cause and \\neffect) rather than citing individually.  By grouping such violations, the NRC applies appropriate \\nfocus on the underlying factors that caused the concerns, so that licensees can develop \\neffective and comprehensive corrective actions. \\n D. Rhoades 3 \\n   In accordance with the NRC Enforcement Policy, the Notice is considered an escalated \\nenforcement action because it is associated with a White finding.  You are required to respond \\nto this letter and should follow the instructions specified in the enclosed Notice when preparing \\n\\nyour response.  If you have additional information that you believe the NRC should consider, \\nyou may provide it in your response to the Notice.  The NRC review of your response to the \\nNotice will also determine whether further enforcement action is necessary to ensure \\n\\ncompliance with regulatory requirements. \\n\\n As a result of this White finding in the Mitigating Systems Cornerstone, the NRC has assessed \\nFitzPatrick to be in the Regulatory Response column of the NRC™s Reactor Oversight Process \\n\\nAction Matrix described in Inspection Manual Chapter 0305, ﬁOperating Reactor Assessment \\nProgram,ﬂ retroactive to the fourth calendar quarter of 2020.

The NRC staff has also determined that the \\nfinding involved violations of 10 CFR Part 50 Appendix B, Criterion VII, Criterion XV, and \\nTS 3.5.1.   \\n However, the NRC staff has revised the finding and violations as described in Enclosures 2 \\nand 3.  Specifically, the NRC staff determined that:  1) the duration of the finding and violations \\nshould be changed from 2010 to 2017 in order to more clearly focus on the time period in which \\n\\nFitzpatrick had become part of the ExGen Fleet; 2) the NRC™s Enforcement Policy holds \\nlicensees accountable for the actions of their employees, contractors and vendors , and, \\ntherefore, the information in ExGen™s response regarding ExGen™s corporate structure and \\n\\ninternal work practices (i.e. roles and responsibilities of ﬁbuyersﬂ and ﬁsellersﬂ) would not impact \\nthe assignment of this regulatory and enforcement action to Fitzpatrick; and, 3) our review of the \\nadditional information provided relative to the risk for this finding did not materially impact our \\nassessment.  In fact, a more comprehensive analysis of some of the information provided may \\nhave actually resulted in an overall increase in our risk assessment.  It should be noted that the \\nviolations are strictly focused on compliance with 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, but should not \\n\\nbe viewed as limiting or impacting any of your internal practices as long as the applicable \\n\\nunderlying regulatory requirements are satisfied.  \\n SUMMARY OF EXGEN COMMENT Œ Independence of Licensed Facilities \\n ExGen stated that the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (JAF) licensed facility and the \\nLimerick Generating Station (LIM) licensed facility are legally independent entities with separate \\n\\nNRC-iss\\nued operating licenses that are supported by common resources as part of the \\nlarger ExGen fleet.  Support resources provided by the Exelon Business Services Company \\n(BSC) and which are assigned to individual licensed facilities are subject to the specific \\noperating license(s) of the facility to which they are assigned.  Therefore, the ability to foresee \\nand prevent the deficiency at LIM (seller) in 2010 should not be a basis for the deficiency being \\nforeseeable and preventable by JAF (buyer) in 2017. \\n NRC RESPONSE \\n Although each facility maintains separate NRC operating licenses, the JAF License No. DPR-59 \\n\\nand the LIM License Nos. NPF-39 and NPF-85 each specify Exelon Generation Company, LLC \\n\\nas the licensee.  However, more salient to this issue is that, upon joining the ExGen fleet in \\n2017, JAF began to utilize and have access to many of the same processes and programs as \\nLIM and other ExGen sites, including the corrective action program and component tracking \\n\\ndatabase.  The NRC identified that both of these programs contained information pertaining to \\nthe defective high pressure coolant injection (HPCI) system oil pressure control valve (PCV).   \\n \\nThe performance deficiency and apparent violations as originally presented in NRC inspection \\nreport number 05000333/2020012 described in full the circumstances that led to the installation \\nof the defective PCV at JAF.  This included describing the failures that occurred in 2010 at LIM \\nEnclosure 1 2 \\n  in response to a Title 10 of the \\nCode of Federal Regulations\\n (10 CFR) Part 21 notification when \\nstaff at that site did not segregate or place an electronic hold on the PCV, contrary to Exelon \\nprocedures.  The NRC staff considered the comments in ExGen™s February 26, 2021, letter \\npertaining to the finding and acknowledges that in 2017, ExGen staff could not have prevented \\n\\nthe process breakdown that occurred at LIM in 2010.  However, the NRC staff maintains that it \\nwas reasonable in 2017 for ExGen staff to have identified the information about the defective \\ncomponent that was readily available in the component tracking database and corrective action \\n\\ndatabase; common ExGen programs utilized by both sites.  For example, when receiving the \\n\\npart, ExGen staff at JAF accessed the component tracking database and removed a 'hold' due \\nto a shelf life concern.  The NRC staff identified that information about the Part 21 notification \\nwas readily available in the database and could reasonably be identified by a qualified \\n\\nprocurement engineer when performing a review of available information to address the ‚hold'. \\nAdditional detail about the NRC staff™s conclusions related to the finding is provided in the NRC \\nresponse to ExGen™s comment below related to the Criterion VII violation. \\n\\n \\nIn light of these considerations, the NRC staff revised the finding and violations to properly focus \\non the events that occurred in 2017.  The circumstances of the 2010 failures are still included in \\nthe Description Section of the finding as background information.  The revised finding and \\n\\nviolations are provided as Enclosures 2 and 3 to this final determination report. \\n SUMMARY OF EXGEN COMMENT - 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion XV \\n The 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion XV violation and associated performance deficiency \\noccurred at the LIM licensed facility in 2010 by support resources working in direct support of \\nthe LIM operating licenses.  The Inspection Report identified an apparent violation of 10 CFR \\n\\nPart 50, Appendix B, Criterion XV, \"Nonconforming Materials, Parts, or Components\" based on \\nthe failure to properly identify and segregate non-conforming material that was identified and \\ncommunicated to LIM by a General Electric-Hitachi (GEH) 10 CFR Part 21 notification.  The JAF \\n\\nCausal Analysis to address the HPCI failure determined that as part of LIM™s response to the \\n2010 GEH 10 CFR Part 21 notification, LIM personnel failed to follow procedure requirements to \\nplace an electronic hold and segregate the defective part.  This allowed the defective part to be \\nsold to JAF in 2017 without being notified of the deficiency. \\n NRC RESPONSE \\n As described above, the NRC staff acknowledges that prior to 2017, ExGen staff at JAF could \\nnot have prevented the 2010 failures at LIM related to identifying and segregating the \\nnon-conforming PCV since JAF was not transferred to ExGen until March 2017.  Therefore, the \\nfinding and the related Criterion XV violation have been revised accordingly.  However, the NRC \\nstaff maintains that the remaining aspect of the finding and Criterion XV violation is attributable \\nto JAF.  Specifically, the regulation requires that licensees establish measures to control \\n\\nmaterials, parts, or components which do not conform to requirements in order to prevent their \\n\\ninadvertent use or installation and to accept, reject, repair, or rework nonconforming items.  \\nRegardless of the past failures to identify and segregate the nonconforming PCV, in 2017 \\nExGen again did not control and reject the nonconforming component, resulting in its \\n\\nacceptance and installation at JAF.  The NRC staff maintains that JAF is responsible for this \\nfailure.   \\n In particular, the activities performed in 2017 to transfer the part between LIM and JAF and to \\naccept and use the part at JAF were performed in support of ExGen and the JAF license.  As  \\nEnclosure 1 3 \\n  noted in Section 1.2 of the NRC Enforcement Policy, it is NRC policy to hold licensees \\nresponsible for the acts of their employees, contractors, or vendors and their employees, and \\nthe NRC may cite the licensee for violations committed by its employees, contractors, or \\n\\nvendors and their employees.  Therefore, regardless of the physical locations of the involved \\n\\nstaff, their reporting authority under the greater Exelon Corporation structure, or the typical \\nresponsibilities of these individuals to support the licensed facilities at which they are located, \\nwhen individuals are directed by a licensee to perform activities that affect that NRC licensee, \\n\\nthat licensee assumes the responsibility for violations caused by the individuals™ actions or \\ninactions. \\n \\nFurthermore, the NRC staff maintains that, in consideration of the common procedures and \\nprocesses shared between LIM and JAF, it was reasonable for ExGen staff at JAF to have \\nforeseen and prevented the acceptance and use of the nonconforming PCV and that ExGen \\nstaff at JAF should have identified and rejected the defective item during receipt inspection \\n\\nactivities conducted in December 2017.  Additional information about the finding is provided in \\nthe NRC response to ExGen™s comment below related to the Criterion VII violation. \\n SUMMARY OF EXGEN COMMENT - 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion VII \\n The receipt inspection completed at JAF in 2017 was performed consistent with the \\nrequirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion VII and the JAF Quality Assurance \\nProgram (QAP) requirements and, therefore, does not constitute a failure to follow a regulatory \\nor self-imposed standard.  The Inspection Report identified a Violation of 10 CFR Part 50, \\n\\nAppendix B, Criterion VII, \"Control of Purchased Material, Equipment, and Servicesﬂ based on \\nthe failure to identify, during receipt inspection, that the purchased valve was the subject of a \\n2010 10 CFR Part 21 notification.  ExGen has confirmed that the JAF receipt inspection was \\nperformed consistent with the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion VII and \\n\\nthe JAF QAP and, therefore, was not a failure to follow a regulatory or self-imposed standard.  \\nAdditionally, without further actions beyond these requirements, the receipt inspector could not \\nreasonably have been expected to identify that the valve was the subject of the 2010 10 CFR \\n\\nPart 21 notification based on the documentation provided by the seller (LIM). \\n NRC RESPONSE \\n Title 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion VII requires that licensees establish measures to \\nassure that purchased material, equipment, and services, whether purchased directly or through \\ncontractors and subcontractors, conform to procurement documents.  However, the measures \\nimplemented by ExGen in 2017 did not identify the nonconformance of the PCV.  A licensee™s \\nQAP and the processes developed to implement that program provide the mechanism for the \\nlicensee to comply with 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B; they do not serve as replacements or \\nalternatives to these regulatory requirements.  Therefore, if a licensee™s QAP, or implementation \\nof the QAP, fails to ensure that the licensee meets an Appendix B requirement, the licensee is \\nin violation of that requirement. \\n \\nThe NRC staff maintains that, in this case, the receipt inspection performed at JAF (the intended \\nmeasure to assure purchased material conformed to procurement documents) was not sufficient \\nto meet this Appendix B requirement.  Specifically, as noted in the finding description in \\n\\nEnclosure 2, the ExGen Quality Assurance Program Manual (QAPM), Revision 0, Section A, \\nﬁManagement,ﬂ stated, ﬁthe requirements and commitments contained in the QAPM are \\nmandatory and must be implemented, enforced, and adhered to by all individuals and \\n\\norganizations.ﬂ  Section 5, ﬁProcurement Verification,ﬂ required a program to be established and \\nEnclosure 1 4 \\n  implemented to verify the quality of purchased items and services.  Section 6, ﬁIdentification and \\nControl of Items,ﬂ required a program to be established and implemented to identify and control \\nitems to prevent the use of incorrect or defective items.  The receipt inspection, conducted using \\n\\nExGen Procedure SM-AA-102, Revision 23, ﬁWarehouse Operations,ﬂ implemented these \\n\\nprocurement verification requirements.  This receipt inspection did not identify that the PCV \\ncontained a defective diaphragm. \\n \\nThe NRC staff maintains that it was reasonably within ExGen™s ability to foresee and prevent the \\nuse of the nonconforming PCV at JAF.  In particular, information about the defective diaphragm \\nwas located in both the ExGen component tracking database and corrective action database.  \\n\\nThe inspectors reviewed the component tracking database and determined that the issue report \\n(IR) associated with the 10 CFR Part 21 report should have been reasonably identified by a \\nqualified procurement engineer.  Notably, when receiving the part, ExGen staff at JAF accessed \\nthe component tracking database and removed a 'hold' due to a shelf life concern.  The NRC \\n\\nstaff identified that information about the Part 21 notification was readily available in the \\ndatabase and could reasonably be identified by a qualified procurement engineer when  \\nperforming a review of available information to address the ‚hold.'  The staff also noted that the \\n\\ninformation was available to staff involved with the transfer of the component to JAF through the \\nExGen corrective action program, because the issue report was noted in the component \\ntracking database and had not been resolved at the time the part was moved to and accepted at \\nJAF.  As such, it was reasonable for ExGen staff responsible for, and in control of, both sides of \\nthe internal transaction that occurred in order to effect the movement of the PCV from LIM to \\nJAF in 2017 to have identified the Part 21 information related to the PCV.\\n  SUMMARY OF EXGEN COMMENT Œ\\n Uncertainties Input for Significance Determination \\n ExGen provided new information and additional insights which the licensee stated reduce some \\n\\nof the calculational uncertainties that weigh into the Significance Determination (SDP).  ExGen \\nindicated that the uncertainties are smaller than characterized in the NRC inspection report and \\ncould potentially result in a significance below the threshold for a White determination. \\n\\n \\n1. The JAF Engineering staff has performed additional engineering reviews related to the \\nmaximum oil leak rate from the HPCI system PCV which provide information supporting the \\nleak rate used in the JAF SDP analysis. \\n 2. JAF Operations staff have gathered and documented additional timeline and performance \\ndata which better characterizes the uncertainty in the analysis of operator credit for \\n\\nidentification and restoration of HPCI oil. \\n 3. JAF Operations and Engineering staff have validated information regarding Main Control \\nRoom (MCR) staff operation of HPCI during transient conditions. \\n 4. JAF Engineering and Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) Staff provided information \\nregarding incorporation of Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) fire realisms and the \\n\\nassociated reduction in fire ignition frequencies (FIFs) for areas that are risk important \\nrelative to HPCI operation. \\n NRC RESPONSE \\n  The NRC staff reviewed the information in ExGen™s written response and determined that the \\nproper characterization of this finding overall remains of low-to-moderate safety significance  \\nEnclosure 1 5 \\n  (White).  The NRC staff agreed that ExGen™s use of revised fire ignition frequencies from those \\nused in the NRC risk determination was appropriate.  However, the slight reduction in the \\ncalculated increase in core damage frequency (CDF) due to a lower fire risk estimate did not \\n\\nimpact the overall NRC risk assessment and significance determination process conclusion.  \\n\\nThe following details the NRC™s assessment regarding the four areas of input provided by \\nExGen for consideration in the SDP:  \\n 1. Calculated Maximum Oil Leak \\n NRC Response \\n ExGen utilized a slightly lower minimum leak rate of 0.19 gallons per minute (gpm) with a \\nmaximum leak rate of 2.8 gpm, which considered higher operating oil temperatures when the \\n\\nsystem would be in service.  The NRC SDP analysis utilized a minimum leak rate of 0.28 gpm \\n\\nwith a maximum leak rate of 3.65 gpm to arrive at a weighted leak rate estimate which would \\naccount for the probability of an early re-positioning of the degraded, nonconforming Part 21 \\npressure control valve (PCV).  As stated in the detailed risk evaluation (DRE), the NRC used \\n\\nindustry data to estimate a probability that an early HPCI system trip would lead to a large leak \\nfrom the PCV.  The early probabilistic trip of the HPCI system was determined to be 0.15 \\nthrough several different methodologies as described within the DRE.  However, the DRE \\n\\ndescribed how this number may be an underestimation of the actual data, even though used in \\nthe development of the weighted leak rate estimation.  It is not uncommon for the HPCI system \\nto be tripped early for level control during postulated events and a sample of industry data \\n\\nreviewed, reflected that an early HPCI trip could occur up to 50 percent of the time based on a \\n\\nreview of a sample of Licensee Event Reports.  This illustrates in part, the uncertainty with \\nevaluating what leak rate would have existed within this degraded part during a postulated event \\nwhere HPCI would have responded.  The NRC noted in the DRE that the initial leak rate \\n\\nsubsequently identified by ExGen was reported as one pint in two minutes, although computer \\ninformation provided to the analysts indicated the pump was run with the PCV at normal \\npressure for only one minute.  Of further concern related to the accuracy of ExGen™s estimated \\n\\nleak rate was the inconsistency between the leak rate assumed in the analysis and the initial \\n\\nleak of 0.25 gpm leak rate that was verbally report\\ned to the resident inspector staff.  As a result, \\nthe analyst determined that the leak rate values provided in the ExGen analysis and follow-up \\nletter were uncertain, underestimated the actual leak rate, and are not viewed as credible. \\n  When ExGen attempted to quantify the leak rate through a second start of the auxiliary oil \\npump, the pump was secured after 30 seconds based on a much larger leak rate that \\n\\noverwhelmed the collection apparatus used to measure the oil quantity.  The 1.3 gpm was \\nbased on the captured oil for the 30 second run.  The analysts noted that the second run was \\nonce again performed with the auxiliary oil pump (AOP), which develops a lower pressure \\n\\n(85-95 psig) than if the shaft driven oil pump (SDOP) was started (105-110 psig) during an \\n\\nactual run.  The output of the controlling pump pressure is controlled by a main oil system PCV, \\nwhich will control downstream pressure to 38 psig.  However, there is some response time by \\nthe main PCV resulting in a slightly higher pressure pulse (i.e. stress) that was expected to have \\n\\nbeen absorbed by the downstream nonconforming PCV diaphragm.  This further adds to the \\nuncertainty, and validity of any measured oil leak when it was performed under non-operating \\nconditions.  Actual turbine operating conditions result in different dynamics relative to the oil \\n\\nsystem, with the potential for an even larger tear on the weakened nonconforming pressure \\ncontrol valve diaphragm.   \\n  Enclosure 1 6 \\n   Notwithstanding the multitude of uncertainties mentioned above, if the NRC were to adjust their \\nweighted leak rate estimate by using a maximum leakage capped at 2.8 gpm or even slightly \\nlower as suggested by ExGen, this would have an inconsequential effect on the amount of time \\n\\nassumed and calculated within the NRC DRE before the SDOP and AOP would lose suction \\n\\ndue to the loss of oil inventory.  The NRC determined the information provided by ExGen would \\nhave no substantive impact in this area, as the uncertainties overwhelm the ExGen™s \\nengineering analysis, including the inputs used in that analysis, for the calculated maximum oil \\n\\nleak rate.  \\n 2. Oil Leak Mitigation/Credited Operator Actions \\n  ExGen™s position is that giving no credit for operators to recover the HPCI system in the event of \\nan oil leak does not recognize proceduralized actions that the operators would take and be \\n\\ncapable of executing.  ExGen contends that operating procedure, OP-15, Revision 68, \\nSection G.10, ﬁAdding Oil to HPCI Sump with HPCI in Service,ﬂ provides explicit guidance to \\nmaintain oil in the running level band.  ExGen states that operators performed a timed \\nwalkdown for recovery actions to maintain adequate oil level in the HPCI sump in the event the \\n\\nHPCI PCV diaphragm had a tear.  The walkdown was reported to result in operators \\nsuccessfully restoring oil in approximately 27.5 minutes.  ExGen stated that with regards to the \\ntime until the leak is located, there are several considerations.  OP-AA-103-102, ﬁWatch-\\n\\nStanding Practicesﬂ outlines expectations for non-licensed operators to monitor all equipment \\nthey are responsible for.  This procedure also establishes post-start and post-shutdown system \\nwalk down requirements to ensure expected system and components response.  Lastly, ExGen \\n\\nstated that if the control room received the HPCI Turbine Bearing Oil Pressure Low annunciator \\n\\nand HPCI operation is required, the main control room (MCR) operators would respond as \\nfollows: \\n  1. If the HPCI Auxiliary Oil Pump did not auto-start, then attempt to manually start the \\npump from the control room. \\n 2. If the annunciator does not clear, then send an operator locally to investigate the reason \\nfor the loss of oil pressure. \\n 3. The field operator would observe a large amount of oil at the HPCI skid and check HPCI \\noil sump level. \\n 4. Operations would perform actions per OP-15, Section F ﬁShutdownﬂ to secure the AOP \\nwhen the HPCI turbine is not rotating. \\n 5. The control room would direct the field operator to add oil to the HPCI sump. \\n  ExGen™s position is that the oil leak can be effectively managed with readily available equipment \\nand procedurally directed operator actions.   \\n  NRC Response \\n  ExGen procured a Vendor Report, EC-631895, ﬁTechnical Evaluation to Support Availability of \\n\\nHPCI System Due to Oil Leak in PCV-12,ﬂ dated June 18, 2020, which was developed \\nregarding the oil leak and determined that there is a nominal 1-inch drop in the oil sump for \\nevery 13 gallons of oil.  During the postulated events evaluated in an SDP such as this, there \\n\\nare multiple assumed failures of various equipment that lead to a path of core damage.  For \\nEnclosure 1 7 \\n   these events, various equipment may be automatically started from emergency diesel \\ngenerators to the reactor core isolation cooling system (RCIC), HPCI, and a multitude of other \\nequipment.  Thus, there can be a multitude of potential response areas required for plant \\n\\noperators, which directly affects their response time.  As noted in the calculation of the \\n\\nmaximum oil leak section above, a probabilistic leak rate could be in the area of 0.7 gpm to an \\nassumed maximum leakrate in the area of 2.8 gpm or higher, depending on the heatup rate of \\nthe oil and any other factors which would have contributed to the PCV diaphragm tear.  As \\n\\nnoted above, a plant operator may enter the HPCI cubicle and check the oil standpipe and with \\nvarious potential oil leak rates possible, the indicated level would likely be well within the sight \\nglass, with zero other operational abnormalities occurring or noticeable, including HPCI turbine \\n\\nand pump bearing temperatures.  This PCV is not located in the front of the machine and \\ndepending on when an operator would check the machine, this leak may not be identified.   \\n The NRC noted that the design of the HPCI control oil system at FitzPatrick does not have a \\n\\nsump low-level alarm.  Additionally, during a leak, it is apparent that other critical early cues of \\nhigher bearing temperatures, low oil pressures, and low sump level would not be available \\nthrough instrumentation and would not provide ensured identification of a notable leak prior to \\n\\ncomplete failure of the system to operate.  Additionally, the assumed leak rate in this SDP \\nevaluation has unquantifiable uncertainties as mentioned above, with the potential to have been \\nlarger than measured in the relatively colder non-turbine operating condition when the tear was \\n\\ninitially generated.  The sequence of events per this design and nonconforming PCV, would be \\na continued leak at an uncertain rate, with a silent effect on the system, the controls, and the \\nannunciators, as there would be no abnormalities until the system would terminate operation \\n\\ndue to complete suction loss of the shaft-driven oil pump (SDOP).  As noted above, the only \\n\\nalarm or cue would be the turbine bearing oil pressure, which would likely not annunciate even \\nwith a large leak, due to a controlling PCV maintaining 38 psig upstream, which would serve to \\ncompensate for the degraded PCV diaphragm leak, and continue to provide downstream flow \\n\\nand pressure to the bearings.   \\n  The first absolute automatic cue for the operators would be this alarm, but it appears, per the \\n\\ndesign, that it would come in after the SDOP would lose its suction prime due to low oil level, \\n\\nresulting in a loss of discharge pressure.  This would drop pressure to the control valve actuator \\nrotating gear pump and result in closure of the control steam valves as well as the turbine stop \\nvalve.  The SDOP will then spin down, with the main auxiliary oil pump (AOP) starting on low oil \\n\\npressure at around 35 psig.  A further uncertainty is the AOP will start and run with no suction \\nhead, likely cavitating as it continues to run without an adequate oil supply.  As noted above, the \\noperators would actually be instructed to start the AOP if it didn™t auto start even with an \\n\\ninadequate suction pressure.  When an operator would arrive in the area, there would be 60 to \\n65 gallons or more of hot oil within the skid area.  There would be no leak visible or identifiable, \\nbecause the nonconforming PCV would have closed on loss of pressure and there would be no \\n\\npressure to drive any further leakage. \\n\\n  In this condition, it would not be obvious if there had been a pipe crack, a severe crack in the \\nvarious control oil piping and fittings, or complete failure of the oil system, and it™s likely \\n\\noperators would be challenged to identify where the oil came from with 120 degree oil \\npotentially scattered within the skid area.  Furthermore, there is another uncertainty with how \\nlong the AOP would have been running, as it does not automatically receive a trip signal, \\n\\nresulting in cavitation without any oil supply and/or if it would have damaged itself.  ExGen \\nstates they would enter section G.10, ﬁAdding Oil to HPCI Oil Sump with HPCI in Service.ﬂ  With \\nthis scenario, however, HPCI would not be in-service as it would be secured automatically \\n\\n(steam valves closed) due to the failure, contrary to the procedure entry definition/description.  \\nEnclosure 1 8 \\n   OP-15, G.10, as written is intended to gather pre-filtered oil and if not prefiltered, to obtain an oil \\nfiltration device and extension cord and fill an oil transfer container from labeled oil barrels in the \\nlube oil storage room per engineering direction.  Again, it should be noted, it is very likely the \\n\\nleak source would be difficult to determine at this point.  Additionally, hooking up a funnel to a \\n\\nleak source appears to not be proceduralized and the placement would not even be recognized \\nin this scenario, not to mention the effects of running the oil system below the AOP suction \\ncapability, with air entrainment or other kinds of potential adverse effects on the AOP and motor.   \\n\\n  Lastly, if recovery of HPCI in this situation became a priority as suggested in ExGen™s response, \\nan operator would have to fill the sump by finding a portable pump along with electricity for \\n\\nﬁsaidﬂ pump (i.e. for LOOP scenarios there likely isn™t normal outlet power), then keep-up with \\nthe potential large leak rate while looking for the leak point.  Then, once the leak point is \\nidentified, the operator needs to build the apparatus to route the leak to the sump.  Additionally, \\na recovery event such as this includes a human error probability (HEP) assessment which \\n\\nwould need to be analyzed on how it may affect the most dominating basic event in this risk \\nanalysis (failure to depressurize event).  This scenario will take cognitive ability to detect what \\nhappened, make decisions and to understand the success path to restore the high pressure \\n\\nsystem, including its recovery feasibility.  In core damage scenarios or cutsets, this HPCI \\nrecovery event would be accompanied by the SPAR model depressurization basic event \\n(ADS-XHE-XM-MDEPR).  This event would now likely justify including a diagnosis as well as an \\naction assessment due to the cognitive nature of understanding and deciding if the operator \\ncould restore a high pressure injection source in time while reactor vessel level is lowering, \\nwhile waiting until EOPs direct depressurization with the potential thought that HPCI is close to \\n\\nbeing brought back to service.  Adding this diagnostic piece to the normal depressurization \\n\\nevent in the SPAR model raises the potential for a higher failure probability by almost an order \\nof magnitude even considering extra time for diagnosis and action to depressurize in the \\nSPAR-H calculation.  Therefore, by including a HPCI recovery event, the failure to depressurize \\n\\nevent could now be considered for increased failure probability due to the diagnosis needed in \\nthis situation.  A rough calculation has shown that this can increase one of the dominating \\npostulated core damage event scenarios such as a loss-of-condenser-heat sink for a 38-day \\nexposure (DRE risk of 4E-7/yr) to an increased risk of 2E-6/yr for this one event.    \\n\\n  In summary, recovery credit including the challenges accompanying this condition, should likely \\nbe considered for an increased failure in the ADS-XHE-XM-MDEPR basic event, which may \\nhave a significant increase in the end result of the previous risk determination and make the \\neffects of recovery credit a non-substantive issue relative to lowering the calculated increase in \\nCDF/yr for this event.  \\n\\n  Notwithstanding this, based on the above uncertainties, the lack of cues within the system \\ndesign, the uncertainties with the leak rate, the uncertainty with the timing and ability to detect \\n\\nthe leak through a walkdown post event for many systems, operator recovery was determined \\n\\nnot to be a feasible action in the primary base case evaluation of the condition, and the \\ninformation provided has no substantive effect on that conclusion.  However, as is always \\nprudent, the NRC analysts performed a sensitivity study using appropriate considerations of \\n\\nrecovery difficulty in the DRE (Cases 3 and 4, used 1 out of 5 recovery) within the report giving \\nsome credit for recovery.  This sensitivity did not account for an evaluation of increasing the \\nfailure to depressurize (basic event) through the model.  If this became a base assumption the \\n\\nSRA believes it would be appropriate to re-analyze for the above consideration which would \\nlikely result in a notable overall increase of the calculated CDF for the HPCI PCV failure.   \\n  \\n Enclosure 1 9 \\n   3. HPCI Operations During Transient Conditions \\n  ExGen has stated that while operating HPCI with drywell pressure greater than 2.7 psig, the full \\n\\nflow path test return valves close to divert all flow to the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV).  To \\n\\ncontrol RPV water level, the main control room (MCR) operators would dial the flow controller \\nback as needed to control the injection rate and maintain level within the required bands \\nestablished in the station Emergency Operating Procedures (EOPs).   \\n\\n  ExGen also acknowledged that running the HPCI pump on minimum flow with the full-flow test \\nreturn valves closed, is not preferred for long term reliability.  However, in response to transient \\n\\nand accident conditions, operations in this manner is consistent with guidance in station EOPs \\nby ensuring the HPCI system remains available as a high-pressure water source.  As such, \\nMCR operators would not secure HPCI if it was running on minimum flow nor would the pump \\n\\nbe damaged during a transient or accident response to the point that sufficient flow could not be \\n\\ndeveloped. \\n  NRC response \\n  The NRC acknowledges that the station EOPs direct level control within the proper bands, using \\nany systems that may be available.  The NRC also recognizes the difficulty with controlling level \\n\\nusing HPCI for various events.  This is illustrated in the Fitzpatrick RCIC System, B 3.5.3, \\ntechnical specification basis document referring to Actions A.1 and A.2.  The Bases states for \\ntransients and certain abnormal events (i.e. which drive the NRC™s risk SDP evaluation), with no \\n\\nloss-of-coolant-accident, RCIC (as opposed to HPCI) is the preferred source of makeup coolant \\n\\nbecause of its relatively small capacity, which allows easier control of the RPV water level.  \\nThus, there is a limited time allowed to restore RCIC to an operable status.  This simply \\nconfirms the challenge of operating HPCI under conditions where there may be lower makeup \\n\\nrequirements. \\n  OP-15, Revision 68, ﬁHigh Pressure Coolant Injection,ﬂ System Description, describes the \\ndesign operating conditions for when pump discharge water flows through the feedwater line \\n\\ninto the RPV, that HPCI will continue to inject 4250 gpm until RPV water level reaches \\n222.5 inches, then HPCI will trip on high RPV water level.  If RPV water level lowers to \\n126.5 inches, HPCI will auto-initiate following a high RPV water level trip.  This simply explains \\n\\nthe automatic design of the system where it is designed to continually, with no operator action, \\ninject, trip and reset as required.  However, the NRC understands that this is not the preferred \\noperation or response as operators are trained and instructed to control RPV level within the \\n\\nproper station EOP designated band without allowing HPCI trips; this description from OP-15 \\nsimply illustrates the design of the system. \\n  \\nAs documented in the NRC SDP evaluation, while we have found no restriction within the \\n\\nFitzpatrick operating procedures specific to HPCI operating in the minimum flow mode taking \\nwater from the condensate storage tank and depleting it to the torus, there are some \\nuncertainties with this operating mode (i.e., low flow only available).  Specifically, there are Terry \\nTurbine Maintenance guides and technical reports/industry guidance applicable to HPCI, which \\nrecognize that the design basis is to deliver constant flowrate to the RPV over a wide range of \\nreactor pressures.  If reduced vessel injection flowrate (i.e., match decay heat for non-LOCA \\n\\ntransients), is required to control level, this is an off-design operation and is time-consuming and \\nrequires operator attention to control.  The pump head versus flow characteristics are relatively \\nflat as flowrate decreases below rated volume and it is recognized that reduced flowrates below \\n\\na nominal 75 percent below design, will likely cause system instability within the control system.  \\nEnclosure 1 10 \\n   Additionally, typical Terry turbine guidance cautions that the pump/turbine controls should not \\nbe operated less than 50 percent of rated flow for a sustained period of time.  Further guidance \\nstates that operating at 10 to 20 percent minimum flow is intended for startup and shutdown \\n\\nonly and severe internal cavitation at high head conditions can result in pump damage. \\n\\n According to ExGen™s above statement, operators would not secure HPCI in the minimum flow \\nmode and therefore may have run the pump in this off-normal condition for long periods of time \\n\\nin postulated events.  There are several uncertainties with the definitive nature of this statement.  \\nFirst, OP-15, Attachment 4, HPCI AUTO INITIATION VERIFICATION and SUBSEQUENT \\nACTIONS, recognizes appropriately, that when operation of HPCI below 3000 gpm is required, \\n\\nmonitoring of the system operation frequently is required to ensure proper operation and if \\noscillations occur then the system is to be operated with the controller in manual.  The NRC \\nrecognizes that if oscillations occur, the flow controller will result in increasing and decreasing \\nspeed changes.  This by itself would create the need for the main PCV within the oil system to \\n\\nrespond to control to 38 psig with changes in the SDOP speed.  Any small delays in PCV \\nresponse could result in pressure changes and or small stress changes to the downstream \\ndegraded PCV diaphragm.  Additionally, OP-15, Attachment 6, ﬁHPCI Operation Flowchart,ﬂ \\n\\nrequires verifying HPCI parameters per Section D of OP-15.  These parameters include \\nmonitoring outboard-end and pump-end vibration levels to ensure less than 0.385 inches per \\nsecond.   \\n\\n  Because this operation may occur for extensive time periods through a mission time up to \\n15 hours, long periods of HPCI operation can be expected in this condition.  The HPCI system \\nis not normally run for long periods on minimum flow and hence there likely is no data available \\n\\non system effects.  Therefore, an additional uncertainty would be if this mode of operation (long \\nterm minimum flow operation) would challenge the procedure™s acceptable pump vibration \\nlevels with the expected cavitation with the pump internals.  If vibration levels would be \\n\\nexceeded, this would be a decision point with regard to operation of the system (i.e. should the \\nsystem be used to fill to the EOP level zone at higher rates, then secured and restarted when \\nboil-off reduced level back to the lower end of the control zone).  It is also unknown how internal \\n\\npump cavitation may affect the HPCI skid itself and if there could be any adverse effects on \\n\\nresonance vibration on the nonconforming degraded PCV diaphragm condition through the \\nmission time, while running in this off-normal condition.  It should be noted if there would be an \\nadverse effect on the nonconforming PCV; this could extend the exposure time going \\n\\nbackwards, factoring in all of the uncertainties mentioned above. \\n  In addition, the DRE documented the basis for the 0.15 trip rate of the turbine based on industry \\n\\noperating data, which is relevant to the expected operator responses for operation of the HPCI \\nturbine.     \\n  \\nIn summary, the statement concluding the operators would stay on minimum flow has \\n\\nuncertainty with the ability to do that, considering the system is designed for much higher \\nflowrates per its design.  Lastly, extended operation on minimum flow will deplete the preferred \\ncondensate storage tank (CST) suction source to the torus, resulting in additional challenges of \\n\\nCST source availability for the longer- term mission and also on control rod drive pump \\ncapability as the CST is depleted for certain events.  Because of the above uncertainties, the \\nNRC SDP used an exposure time above 38 days (i.e., 59 days) for only a very few applicable \\n\\nevents.     \\n  Notwithstanding the many uncertainties identified above with the definitive statements of not \\nsecuring HPCI if operating on extended minimum flow conditions, the NRC in response to this  \\nEnclosure 1 11 \\n   letter and statement of expected operations, revised the 59-day exposure times for the \\nevents to 38 days to determine its impact on the SDP.  The result was there was an \\ninconsequential difference for the few events where the longer exposure time was used and \\n\\nthe final determination of a low to moderate risk significant issue remained unchanged. \\n\\n 4. Fire Analysis \\n The JAF PRA staff developed and used updated fire modeling ignition frequencies for the fire \\nareas reviewed in the NRC SDP analysis.  The NRC analysis had used fire scenario \\nfrequencies listed in the Fitzpatrick Fire PRA notebook at the time of the evaluation \\n\\n(JF-PRA-021.11 ﬁJames A. FitzPatrick - Fire Probabilistic Risk Analysis Summary &amp; \\nQuantitative Notebook,ﬂ Revision 2).  ExGen™s position is that the fire ignition frequencies in the \\nJAF analysis should be used because they are based on more realistic fire modeling \\n\\nfrequencies. \\n\\n NRC response \\n  The NRC concurs that the JAF updated fire frequencies would result in smaller frequencies and \\nreduction in the \\nNRC fire model risk assessment.  The SPAR Delta CDF increase was \\ncalculated to be 9.9E-7/yr.  Using the revised frequencies, the Delta CDF in Table 2 of ExGen™s \\n\\nletter resulted in a total of 5.6E-7/yr risk increase.  It should be noted fire risk was not a \\ndominant contributor to this risk assessment. \\n NRC Overall Risk Determination Conclusion \\n  The NRC does not believe the information and analysis presented by ExGen is substantive in its \\nnature in reducing the uncertainties and/or influencing a change in the final determination of \\n\\nsignificance below the threshold for a White determination, in part, for the various reasons \\nmentioned above. \\n  \\nHowever, the NRC analysts reviewed all the information presented by ExGen in their \\n\\nFebruary 26, 2021 letter and performed a final sensitivity using all the suggested considerations \\nprovided by ExGen™s supporting information. \\n  \\nThe NRC analyst™s final sensitivity revised the exposure times from 59 days to 38 days based \\non the potential for survival of HPCI remaining on minimum flow and never being tripped or \\nsecured during the course of mission times up to 24 hours.  The NRC analysts used the HPCI \\n\\nrecovery credit (0.8) as documented in the original DRE, however it should be noted this was \\nnot the base case and they did not evaluate the effect this could have or potential increase on \\nthe dominant basic event, (failure to depressurize), as mentioned above in the recovery section.  \\n\\nFinally, the analysts used the lower fire risk increase presented by ExGen.  With all these \\n\\nsensitivity changes, the increase in risk for internal events, flooding, fire and seismic resulted in \\na revised conditional increase in CDF/yr of a nominal 2E-6/yr.  It should be noted these changes \\nwere only performed as a sensitivity as the NRC determined the information presented had no \\n\\nsubstantive effect on the risk outcome (i.e., 3E-6/yr) and did not change the original SRA PRA \\nmodeling assumptions, except for the fire ignition frequencies used.  All other PRA modeling \\nassumptions have been documented and justified within the existing DRE.   \\n\\n  Although some of the information provided within this letter may suggest there could be a \\npotential for an increase in risk over that which was originally calculated, the analysts believed \\nEnclosure 1 12 \\n   the original estimate remains a valid best-estimate given the information and uncertainties \\nrelevant to this issue. \\n RISK SUMMARY \\n  In summary, the NRC staff carefully reviewed the responses provided by ExGen.  The NRC \\n\\nstaff acknowledges and considered ExGen™s viewpoint, but ultimately determined that the new \\n\\ninformation did not alter the NRC™s original risk assessment outcome or methodology as \\ndescribed in Inspection Report 05000333/2020012, dated January 21, 2021 (ADAMS Accession \\nNumber:  ML21020A108).  Based upon the additional information provided, the NRC staff \\n\\nconcluded that the finding remains appropriately characterized as White. \\n     ENCLOSURE 2 \\n REVISED FINDING \\n Defective Part Results in High Pressure Coolant Injection System Pressure Control Valve \\nFailure \\nCornerstone Significance Cross-Cutting Aspect Report Section \\nMitigating Systems \\n White NOV  \\n05000333/   \\n2020012-01  \\nOpen \\nEA-20-138 \\n[H.1] - Resources 71153 \\nThe inspectors documented a self-revealed White finding and related violations of Title 10 of \\nthe \\nCode of Federal Regulations \\n(10 CFR) Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion VII, ﬁControl of \\nPurchased Material, Equipment, and Services,ﬂ and Criterion XV, ﬁNonconforming Materials, \\n\\nParts, or Components,ﬂ  because Exelon Generation, LLC (ExGen) did not adhere to \\nrequirements to ensure that a high pressure \\ncoolant injection (HPCI)\\n system oil pressure \\ncontrol valve (PCV) conformed to all procurement requirements.  Consequently, ExGen did \\n\\nnot reject the defective PCV, as identified in a 10 CFR Part 21 notification.  As a result, \\nExGen accepted and installed the part at FitzPatrick on December 16, 2017.  The HPCI \\nsystem was subsequently declared inoperable on April 10, 2020, during a planned \\n\\nsurveillance test due to the defect identified in the Part 21 notification.  This also caused the \\n\\nHPCI system to be inoperable for greater than its technical specification allowed outage time \\nin accordance with NRC reportability guidelines. \\n Description:  The HPCI system at FitzPatrick provides an emergency source of water \\nfollowing a transient or accident.  This high pressure source of coolant is delivered from two \\nwater sources using steam generated from the reactor to drive the associated turbine and \\npump.  The HPCI system pump can deliver up to 4,250 gallons per minute and may be \\noperated across a wide range of reactor pressures.  The HPCI system pump and turbine are \\n\\nsupported by an oil system designed to lubricate bearings and provide adequate pressure to \\ncontrol the steam turbine stop and control valves. \\n \\nOn November 7, 2017, the NRC issued Order NRC-2017-0177 establishing Exelon \\nGeneration, LLC (ExGen) as the owner, operator, and holder of the FitzPatrick Renewed \\nFacility Operating License No. DPR-59.  ExGen owns or co-owns and operates 22 nuclear \\n\\nreactors at 13 sites in four states.  As stated, in part, in the application dated August 18, 2016 \\n(ML16235A081), and approved by NRC Order NRC-2017-0177, ExGen provided that:  \\n ﬁ–integration of the operation of FitzPatrick with Exelon Generation™s \\n\\ncurrent fleet of nuclear power plants, will allow consolidated operations of \\nFitzPatrick and the other nuclear units operated by Exelon Generation.  \\nThe seamless integration of FitzPatrick into Exelon Generation™s \\n\\noperations will create a single organization with responsibility over all of \\nthe plants for which it is the licensed operator.ﬂ \\n Exelon Corporation, the parent company of ExGen, also operates a central supply \\norganization (Business Services Company, LLC (BSC)) that provides support for day-to-day \\nnuclear station (site) operations with a dual reporting relationship to the centralized supply \\n\\norganization and the site organization.  ExGen implements a fleet-wide quality assurance \\nprogram, along with procurement and warehouse procedures for all its associated nuclear \\nEnclosure 2 2 \\n   stations to verify, store, and move components\\n between stations using BSC personnel.  Once \\naccepted within the ExGen Quality Management System, a component can be installed at the \\nsite of receipt, or moved and installed at another facility. \\n\\n \\nOn December 11, 2008, ExGen received, inspected, and accepted a HPCI oil pressure \\ncontrol valve, stock code 11466532.  On July 1, 2010, ExGen was notified of a defective part \\nwhen General Electric-Hitachi issued MFN 10-192 (ML101820160), ﬁPart 21 Reportable \\nCondition Notification: Failure of HPCI Turbine Overspeed Reset Control Valve \\nDiaphragm.ﬂ  The Part 21 identified a vulnerab\\nility associated with the HPCI system oil PCV \\nactuator diaphragm due to a manufacturing error.  This error resulted in inadequate fabric \\n\\nreinforcement that is critical to ensure durability and reliability of the diaphragm, preventing \\n\\ntearing of the diaphragm when used in the HPCI turbine lube oil system turbine trip and reset \\nvalves (PCVs).  The failure of the HPCI system PCV™s diaphragm results in a loss of HPCI \\nsystem turbine lubricating and control oil through the failed diaphragm.  According to the \\nPart 21 notification, ﬁdepending on the amount of oil lost and the system demands, this loss \\ncould ultimately result in a failure of the HPCI system.ﬂ  ExGen engineering staff entered \\nissue report (IR) 1086768 into their corrective action program and assigned actions including \\n\\ndirection to BSC staff to address the Part 21.  \\n Exelon procedure SM-AA-102, ﬁWarehouse Operations,ﬂ Revision 14, Attachment 3, \\n\\nSection 1.5.2 required, ﬁItems found to be of suspect quality or deficient (e.g., items identified \\n\\nexternally via 10 CFR Part 21 defect reporting or items identified internally by maintenance) \\nshall be: \\n \\n1.    Placed on ‚Hold™ status electronically to prevent allocation and inadvertent issue.  In  \\n       Passport this may require the item to be issued from stock, then returned, moved from  \\n      [pending] to [hold] status.  \\n 2.    Physically segregated from acceptable items with the same Catalog ID/Stock Code.ﬂ  \\n \\nBSC staff working for ExGen at Limerick identified a PCV subject to the Part 21 notification at \\nthe Limerick facility, but did not segregate or place an electronic ‚hold™ on the PCV in their \\ncomponent tracking database to prevent PCV installation with the defective diaphragm as \\nrequired by internal procedures following the July 1, 2010, Part 21 notification.  BSC staff \\ndocumented the nonconformance in the component tracking database which referenced \\nIR 1086768.  However, procedure SM-AA-102 did not include a standard method to \\ndocument Part 21 deficiencies within the component tracking database.  Instead, there were \\n\\nseveral options for documenting a Part 21 notification within this system, and ExGen relied on \\nskill of the craft for determining how to implement the procedural requirement. \\n On November 19, 2010, SM-AA-102 was revised to require, ﬁconspicuous signage that \\n\\nshows these items are on hold,ﬂ in addition to the electronic hold and physical separation.  \\nHowever, BSC staff at Limerick did not use conspicuous signage on the PCV. \\n On December 16, 2017, ExGen issued purchase order (P.O.) 637326 to move the HPCI \\nsystem PCV from the Limerick warehouse to FitzPatrick during a planned HPCI system \\nmaintenance window.  During a HPCI maintenance window in December 2017, ExGen \\nreplaced the HPCI PCV diaphragm and spring as part of preventive maintenance.  Following \\n\\nmaintenance, ExGen was unsuccessful at restoring HPCI due to inadequate pressures in the \\noil system.  ExGen did not have a replacement PCV on site at the time, and subsequently \\nlocated the subject PCV at Limerick. \\nEnclosure 2 3 \\n   To effect the movement of the part, BSC staff at Limerick and FitzPatrick followed the \\nprocess prescribed in the ExGen Quality Assurance Program Manual (QAPM), \\nRevision 0.  QAPM Section A, ﬁManagement,ﬂ stated, ﬁthe requirements and commitments \\ncontained in the QAPM are mandatory and must be implemented, enforced, and adhered to \\n\\nby all individuals and organizations.ﬂ  QAPM, Section 5, ﬁProcurement Verification,ﬂ required \\nthat, ﬁa program is established and implemented to verify the quality of purchased items and \\nservices at intervals and to a depth consistent with the item's or service's importance to \\n\\nsafety, complexity, and quantity and the freq\\nuency of procurement.ﬂ  QAPM, Section 6, \\nﬁIdentification and Control of Items,ﬂ required a program to be established and implemented \\nto identify and control items to prevent the use of incorrect or defective items.   \\n\\n \\nThe inspectors determined that, in spite of utilizing the above process, staff involved with \\ntransferring the HPCI PCV and inspecting and accepting it at FitzPatrick did not identify the \\nnonconformance, even though the information was readily available in both the ExGen \\n\\ncomponent tracking database and corrective action database.  The defective valve was \\naccepted using a Product Quality Certificate dated December 12, 2008.  This Product Quality \\nCertificate was invalidated by the July 1, 2010 Part 21 notification.  The PCV was \\n\\nsubsequently installed in the FitzPatrick HPCI system during the maintenance window on \\nDecember 16, 2017.   \\n \\nStaff involved with transferring the HPCI PCV and inspecting and accepting it at FitzPatrick \\nreasonably had access to information about the nonconformance through at least two \\nmeans.  First, to receive the part at FitzPatrick, BSC staff at FitzPatrick accessed the \\ncomponent tracking database and removed a 'hold' due to a shelf life concern.  The \\n\\ninspectors reviewed the component tracking database and identified that information on \\nIR 1086768, the IR associated with the 10 CFR Part 21 notification, was present in the \\ndatabase and could reasonably be identified by a qualified procurement engineer when \\n\\nperforming a review of available information to address the ‚hold'.  Second, the Part 21 \\ninformation was available to the staff through the ExGen corrective action program, as \\nIR 1086768 was noted in the component tracking database.  The IR had not been resolved at \\n\\nthe time the part was moved to and accepted at FitzPatrick, and this information would have \\nbeen available to any staff involved with this activity. \\n As a result of the defective part installation, on April 10, 2020, at 1:15 AM, while conducting \\nmonthly technical specification surveillance testing of the HPCI auxiliary oil system, operators \\nidentified an oil leak on pressure control valve (PCV), 23PCV-12.  The auxiliary oil pump was \\nsecured and the HPCI system was still considered operable by ExGen staff.  Operators were \\n\\nnot able to definitively quantify the initial leak.  At 3:00 AM, a second start of the auxiliary oil \\npump was attempted to quantify the leak.  During the second run, operators estimated the \\nleak to be 1.3 gpm.  Thus, the HPCI system was declared inoperable and placed the station \\ninto a higher licensee-established risk category (Yellow).  ExGen notified the NRC of the \\ninoperability per 10 CFR Part 50.72(b)(3)(v)(D) via Event Notification 54647.  The 23PCV-12 \\nvalve was replaced and the HPCI system restored to operable status on April 10, 2020, \\nat 8:02 PM. \\n  Corrective Actions:  ExGen performed immediate corrective actions to replace the defective \\nHPCI system PCV.  ExGen also performed a fleet-wide stand down for procurement staff \\n\\nto conduct additional training.  Additionally, ExGen created a separate action for each ExGen \\nsite to validate that a similar condition does not exist regarding dispositioning Part 21 \\ncomponents with inaccurate codes in their parts tracking database.  Furthermore, ExGen \\nEnclosure 2 4 \\n   revised its warehouse and procurement procedures, adding steps pertaining to items subject \\nto 10 CFR Part 21 notifications and items with holds. \\n  \\nCorrective Action References:  IR 4334315, IR 4348906 \\nPerformance Assessment: \\n  Performance Deficiency:  The inspectors determined that ExGen failed to ensure that \\n\\npurchased material conformed to all procurement requirements and to reject a nonconforming \\n\\nitem and prevent its installation and use as required by 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion \\nVII, ﬁControl of Purchased Material, Equipment, and Services,ﬂ and Criterion XV, ﬁNon-\\nconforming Materials, Parts, and Components,ﬂ which was within their ability to foresee and \\n\\nprevent.  \\n ExGen implemented the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B using the Quality \\n\\nAssurance Program Manual (QAPM), Revision 0 in 2017.  Section A, ﬁManagement,ﬂ stated, \\nﬁthe requirements and commitments contained in the QAPM are mandatory and must be \\nimplemented, enforced, and adhered to by all individuals and organizations.ﬂ  Section 5, \\nﬁProcurement Verification,ﬂ required a program to be established and implemented to verify \\n\\nthe quality of purchased items and services.  Section 6, ﬁIdentification and Control of Items,ﬂ \\nrequired a program to be established and implemented to identify and control items to \\nprevent the use of incorrect or defective items.  Procedure SM-AA-102 implemented these \\n\\nprocurement verification requirements.  \\n On December 16, 2017, ExGen failed to verify that the PCV conformed to procurement \\n\\ndocuments and did not identify that the PCV was nonconforming.  Consequently, the PCV \\ncontaining the defective diaphragm was not rejected and was, instead, accepted using a \\nProduct Quality Certificate dated December 9, 2008, which was subsequently invalidated by \\nthe Part 21 notification issued July 1, 2010.  The PCV was installed at FitzPatrick on \\n\\nDecember 16, 2017 and failed on April 10, 2020. \\n  Screening:  The inspectors determined the performance deficiency was more than minor \\n\\nbecause it was associated with the Equipment Performance attribute of the Mitigating \\nSystems cornerstone and adversely affected the cornerstone objective to ensure the \\navailability, reliability, and capability of systems that respond to initiating events to prevent \\n\\nundesirable consequences.  Specifically, the HPCI system was unavailable to perform its \\nsafety function as a result of the failed PCV. \\n  Significance:  The inspectors assessed the significance of the finding using Appendix A, ﬁThe \\n\\nSignificance Determination Process (SDP) for Findings At-Power.ﬂ  The inspectors reviewed \\nInspection Manual Chapter (IMC) 0609, Attachment 4, ﬁInitial Characterization of Findings,ﬂ \\nand determined the finding affects the mitigating system cornerstone.  The inspectors \\n\\nevaluated the significance of this finding using Inspection Manual Chapter (IMC) 0609,  \\nAppendix A, ﬁThe Significance Determination Process (SDP) for Findings at Power,ﬂ Exhibit 2 \\nŒ Mitigating Systems Screening Questions.  The inspectors determined that the finding \\nrepresented a loss of the PRA function of a single train, the HPCI system, for greater than its \\n\\ntechnical specification (TS) allowed outage time and required a detailed risk evaluation \\n(DRE). \\n A Region I Senior Reactor Analyst (SRA) performed a detailed risk evaluation.  The finding \\nwas determined to be of low to moderate safety significance (White).  The risk important core \\ndamage sequences were dominated by internal events, primarily loss of condenser heat sink \\nEnclosure 2 5 \\n   and loss of main feedwater.  The dominant core damage sequence is loss of condenser heat \\nsink, failure of high-pressure injection (HPI), and failure to manually depressurize the \\nreactor.  See Enclosure 1 to this final determination report and the Attachment, ﬁHPCI Oil \\nPCV Failure Detailed Risk Evaluation,ﬂ to the preliminary determination report (ADAMS \\nAccession Number: ML21020A108) for a detailed review of the quantitative and qualitative \\ncriteria considered in the final risk determination. \\n Cross-Cutting Aspect:  H.1 - Resources: Leaders ensure that personnel, equipment, \\nprocedures, and other resources are available and adequate to support nuclear safety.  The \\ncause of the finding was determined to be associated with a cross-cutting aspect \\n\\nof Resources in the Human Performance area because ExGen staff failed to identify and \\naddress a nonconformance during verification of the quality of the HPCI system \\nPCV.  Specifically, the inspectors determined there were multiple ways for ExGen to \\nreasonably identify a nonconformance associated with the PCV diaphragm which had not \\n\\nbeen addressed.  Furthermore, procurement implementing procedures did not provide \\nadequate guidance to ensure that procedure users would identify and resolve this issue.  \\nHaving comprehensive steps within the relevant procedure would likely have prevented \\ninstallation of the defective part at FitzPatrick. \\n   ENCLOSURE 3 \\n NOTICE OF VIOLATION \\n Exelon Generation Company, LLC     Docket No.  50-333 \\nJames A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant    License No. DPR-59 \\n                 EA-20-138 \\n                    \\nDuring an NRC inspection conducted from April 10, 2020, through December 14, 2020, and for \\nwhich an inspection exit meeting was conducted on December 14, 2020, violations of NRC \\n\\nrequirements were identified.  In accordance with the \\nNRC Enforcement Policy, the violations \\nare listed below:  \\n A. Title 10 of the \\nCode of Federal Regulations\\n (10 CFR) Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion VII, \\nﬁControl of Purchased Material, Equipment, and Services,ﬂ requires, in part, that \\nmeasures shall be established to assure that purchased material, equipment, and \\nservices, whether purchased directly or through contractors and subcontractors conform \\n\\nto procurement documents. Documentary evidence that material and equipment conform \\nto the procurement requirements shall be available at the nuclear power plant or fuel \\nprocessing plant site and shall be sufficient to identify the specific requirements, such as \\n\\ncodes, standards, or specifications, met by the purchased material or equipment.  \\n Contrary to the above, on December 16, 2017, the licensee did not ensure measures \\n\\nwere established to assure that purchased material, equipment and services conform to \\n\\nprocurement documents.  Specifically, the licensee did not ensure that a replacement \\nhigh pressure coolant injection (HPCI) system oil pressure control valve (PCV) \\nconformed to procurement documents.  As a result, on December 16, 2017, the licensee \\n\\naccepted and installed for use a PCV at the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant \\n(FitzPatrick) that had a known nonconforming material defect (i.e., defective diaphragm) \\nthat was first identified in a 10 CFR Part 21 report on July 3, 2010.  \\n B. Title 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion XV, ﬁNonconforming Materials, Parts, or \\nComponents,ﬂ requires that measures shall be established to control materials, parts, or \\ncomponents which do not conform to requirements in order to prevent their inadvertent \\n\\nuse or installation.  Nonconforming items shall be reviewed and accepted, rejected, \\nrepaired, or reworked in accordance with documented procedures. \\n \\nFitzPatrick Technical Specification (TS 3.5.1), in part, requires the HPCI system to be \\noperable in Modes 1, 2, and 3 with reactor steam dome pressure &gt;150 psig.  If the HPCI \\nsystem is determined to be inoperable, it shall be returned to an operable status within \\n\\n14 days.  If not restored to an operable status, the unit shall be shut down and in Mode 3 \\n\\nwithin 12 hours.  \\n Contrary to the above, from December 16, 2017, to April 10, 2020, the licensee did not \\n\\nensure that measures were established to control materials, parts, or components which \\ndo not conform to requirements in order to prevent their inadvertent use or installation \\nand did not ensure that nonconforming items shall be reviewed and accepted, rejected, \\n\\nrepaired, or reworked in accordance with documented procedures.  Specifically, staff \\ninvolved with the sale, inspection, and installation of the HPCI PCV to FitzPatrick failed \\nto ensure the PCV conformed to all procurement requirements and failed to reject the \\n\\nnonconforming item.  As a result, the valve was accepted and installed for use at \\nEnclosure 3 2 \\n   FitzPatrick.  On April 10, 2020, the HPCI system was declared inoperable during a \\nmonthly surveillance test as a result of a leak and system oil loss from the \\nnonconforming HPCI PCV that would have prevented the system from performing its \\n\\nsafety function.  Consequently, the HPCI system was rendered inoperable prior to  \\n\\nApril 10, 2020, for a period longer than its TS allowed outage time, and the unit was not \\nshut down and placed in Mode 3 within 12 hours in accordance with NRC reportability \\nguidelines.\\n   These violations are categorized collectively as a problem and are associated with a White \\nSignificance Determination Process finding. \\n Pursuant to the provisions of 10 CFR 2.201, Exelon Generation Company, LLC (the licensee) is \\nhereby required to submit a written statement or explanation to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory \\n\\nCommission, ATTN:  Document Control Desk, Washington, DC 20555-0001 with a copy to the \\nRegional Administrator, Region I, and a copy to the NRC Resident Inspector at the facility that is \\nthe subject of this Notice, within 30 days of the date of the letter transmitting this Notice of \\nViolation (Notice).

All other \\nUnit \\n2 ADS valves were successfully\\n cycled open and closed\\n.  Licensee investigation revealed \\nthe cause of the failure was an out\\n-of-specification plunger received from the vendor.\\n  The failed actuator for the \\nADS valve\\n had been originally installed in March\\n 2018 and t\\nhe licensee \\ndetermined that \\nthe ADS valve \\nwas \\ninoperable for the entire \\nfuel \\ncycle.\\n This accident sequence precursor (ASP) analysis reveals that the most likely core damage \\nsequences involve internal event \\nscenarios that result in \\na loss of \\nservice \\nwater transient with \\nfailure of SRVs to close and failure of \\nall \\nhigh\\n-pressure injection\\n sources\\n [reactor core isolation \\ncooling (RCIC) and high\\n-pressure coolant injection \\n(HPCI)]\\n.  This accident sequence account\\ns for approximately 5\\n5 percent of the increase in \\nthe \\n\\nevent.  The \\nmean\\n \\n3×10-5, which is dominated\\n from internal event\\n scenarios (\\n\\n).  The risk from internal floods, \\nseismic \\nevents\\n, high winds, \\nand tornados, \\ncontributes \\nless \\nthan 3 percent\\n to the total \\n for this \\nevent\\n.  Due to the\\n lack of modeling of internal fires\\n, the impact of internal fires \\nis considered \\nqualitatively\\n. No licen\\nsee \\nperformance deficiency\\n (PD)\\n associated with this event\\n was\\n identified and,\\n therefore, an ASP analysis was performed since a Significance Determination Process (SDP)\\n evaluation was not performed\\n. 2 EVENT \\nDETAILS \\n  2.1 Event Description\\n On March 30, 2020, with Unit 2 in shutdown for a refueling outage, \\nelectromatic \\nrelief \\nvalve \\n2-0203-3D \\nof the ADS \\nfailed to actuate\\n during performance of \\na TS surveillance \\ntest.\\n  All other \\nUnit 2 \\nADS valves were successfully\\n cycled open and closed\\n.  A Lice\\nnsee investigation \\nrevealed \\nthe cause of the failure was an out\\n-of-specification plunger received from the vendor.\\n  LER 2\\n65-2020-002  2 The failed actuator for the \\nADS valve\\n had been originally installed in March\\n 2018 and t\\nhe licensee determined that the ADS valve was \\ninoperable for the entire \\nfuel \\ncycle.\\n The failed ADS valve \\nactuator was dissembled and inspected to determine the cause of the \\nfailure. \\n The plunger width was found to be different from the top to mid\\n-length indic\\nating the \\nlegs \\nwere\\n splay\\ned and this plunger width was outside the manufacturer's tolerance. \\n The plunger width was not a\\n parameter that was measured during vendor dedication until 2019, after \\nthe rebuild of the\\n actuator in 2018.\\n  Additional information\\n is provided in\\n licensee event report \\n(LER) 269-2020\\n-002, \"Electromatic\\n Relief Valve 3D Did Not Actuate Due to Out of Specification \\nPlunger\\n,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No\\n.

NRC inspectors\\n determined\\n that the failure\\n was not reasonably foreseeable and preventable by the licensee \\nand, therefore\\n, is not a performance deficiency.  \\nThe LER was \\nreviewed and closed \\nin\\n inspection report \\n 05000265/2020002, ﬁIntegrated Inspection Report 05000254/2020002 and \\n05000265/2020002,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML20225A008\\n).  An independent ASP analysis \\nwas performed because no\\n licensee PD\\n was \\nidentified and the potential \\nfor \\nrisk significance of \\nthis event.\\n Additional LE\\nRs were reviewed to determine if unavailabilities existed \\nconcurrently with \\nthe ADS\\n valve\\n failure\\n.  One \\nwindowed event \\nof a concurrent degraded condition w\\nas identified.\\n  LER\\n 265-20-001, \"Loss of Both Divisions of Residual Heat Removal Low Pressure Coolant \\nInjection Due to Swing Bus Failure to Transfer,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML20140A093), \\nreported \\na motor \\ncontrol \\ncenter (MCC) failed to transfer between buses during the performance \\n of testing\\n.  This resulted in \\nthe licensee \\ndeclaring both loops of \\nlow-pressure \\ncoolant \\ninjection \\n(LPCI) inoperable\\n.  The failure \\nof the \\nauto-transfer would \\nprevent\\n the LPCI \\ninject\\nion valves \\nfrom \\nopening.\\n  The apparent cause of the event was a manufacturing error in the LPCI swing bus \\ntime delay relay.  Prior to installation of the relay in 2018, bench testing and calibration were \\nsuccessfully \\nperformed\\n.  An analysis assuming the fa\\niled MCC auto\\n-transfer and ADS valve for \\na maximum of 1 year show\\ns that the MCC auto\\n-transfer \\nhas a negligible\\n impact \\non the risk of \\nADS valve failure and, therefore, is not further considered in this \\nASP analysis\\n. 3.2 Exposure \\nTime\\n The Licensee reported that the ADS valve was found to be inoperable for the entire operating \\ncycle.  Therefore, the exposure time was set to the maximum of one year in accordance with \\nof \\nVolum\\ne 1 of the RASP Handbook\\n, \"Risk Assessment of Operational Events (RASP) Handbook\\n,\" Revision 2.02, \\n(ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML17348A149\\n). 3.3 Analysis Type\\n A condition \\nanalysis was performed using \\nRevision\\n 8.59 of the \\nstandardized plant analysis risk \\n(SPAR) model f\\nor \\nQuad Cities Nuclear\\n Power Station \\n(Unit\\n 1) Test and Limited Use \\nModel LER 2\\n65-2020-002  3 (TLU)\\n0F\\n1, revision dated September 24, 2020\\n.

B. DESCRIPTION OF EVENT On March 30, 2020, with Unit 2 in shutdown for refueling outage 02525, during performance of the Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.5.1.10, the 2-0203-3D Electromatic Relief Valve (ERV)[RV] failed to actuate. TS SR 3.5.1.10 requires each Automatic Depressurizing System (ADS)[BF] valve actuator stroke when manually actuated. All other ADS valves on Unit 2 were found to stroke successfully. The 2-0203-3D actuator was replaced and stroked successfully prior to completion of refueling outage Q2R25 restoring the system to operable. The failed actuator for the 2-0203-3D ERV had been originally installed in March 2018 after having been rebuilt in February 2018 in preparation for the Q2R24 refueling outage. The actuator had been rebuilt in accordance with site maintenance rebuild procedure. On April 5, 2018, during an Auto Slowdown Functional Test operating surveillance, the 2-0203-3D ERV did not initially actuate as expected with the ERV remaining in the closed position. An Issue Report {IR) was generated, and troubleshooting was performed to smooth the actuator plunger sides to correct the actuator sticking. It was subsequently cycled three times successfully and was returned to service. Following the 2020 failure, the removed 2-0203-3D ERV actuator was dissembled and inspected to determine the cause of the failure. The initial observations and stroking of the actuator with the cover removed noted that the upper guide bracket was tilted down on the left end. As the actuator was stroked and returned to the standby state, the tilt of the upper guide bracket would vary from stroke to stroke causing the sticking of the actuator to be intermittent. Observation of the plunger during testing noted that it would intermittently rub with the lever arm on the left side. The plunger width was found to be different from the top \\nto mid-length indicating \\nthe legs are splaying. This plunger width was outside the manufacturer's tolerance for plunger width. The measured width of 2.592\" is 0.027\" larger than the manufacturer's toleranc.e for plunger width of 2.565\".

LER NUMBER SEQUENTIAL NUMBER 002 REV NO. 00 This is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specification. TS 3.5.1 Condition Hallows one ADS valve to be inoperable for a period of 14 days. The 2-0203-3D ERV was found to be inoperable for the entire cycle. C. CAUSE OF EVENT The cause of the failure was an out of specification plunger received from the vendor. The bent upper guide bracket was able to perform acceptably while installed during previous operating cycles but would only begin binding when initiated by the plunger. D. SAFETY ANALYSIS System Design The 2-0203-3D ERV is part of the ADS. The ADS consist of five valves [4 relief valves (ERVs) and one safety/relief valve (Target Rock valve)]. Per the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) 6.3.3.1.4, \"The ADS is designed to depressurize the reactor to permit either the Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) or Core Spray subsystem to cool the reactor core during a small breaker Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA).\" Pressure relief of the reactor vessel may be accomplished manually by the operator or without operator action by the automatic depressurization circuitry. Safety Impact Per TS Bases 3.5.1 Condition H.1, with one ADS valve out service, the overall reliability of the ADS is reduced, because a single failure in the OPERABLE ADS valves could result in a reduction in depressurization capability. In addition, TS Bases for SR 3.5.10 states the actuator of each of the ADS Electromatic valves (ERVs) and the dual function safety/relief valves (S/RVs) is stroked to verify that the pilot valve strokes when manually actuated. This SR, together with the valve testing performed as required by American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) code for pressure relieving devices, verify the capability of each relief valve to perform its function. Per UFSAR 6.3.3.1.4, Automatic Depressurization Subsystem, \"All five available ADS valve were assumed operable in the LOCA analysis. One ADS valve from the five valves modeled in the LOCA analyses was assumed to fail for the single failure evaluation resulting in the operation of four valves being credited.\" Based on the ADS system design and accident/transient analysis, four of five ADS valves are needed to perform the required safety function. An engineering evaluation concluded that the plant design/licensing bases were met for the past cycle (Q2C25) with the one failed ERV. Because of the number of successful stroke tests performed on the other ERVs, the out of specification plunger was determined not to be an issue with other ERVs. The target rock valve design is significantly different from the ERVs and therefore, this issue does not apply to the Target Rock valve. This event is a Maintenance Rule Functional Failure (MRFF).

The 30 ERV and actuator were replaced and successfully tested. Follow Up: 1. Determine and implement appropriate purchase requirements to ensure new plungers meet the vendor specifications. 2. In conjunction with the vendor, review plunger out of specification width for Part 21 implications. 3. Enhance Maintenance ERV actuator rebuild procedure to include the following: a. Improved upper guide bracket inspection criteria b. New alignment criteria c. Additional PMT strokes d. New plunger to switch plate check e. Ensure plunger width is within manufacturing specification or replace plunger F. PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES A review of previous QCNPS events reveals a similar event in 2010 in which the valve main disc would not open during its inspection. Similar to this event, the 2010 event resulted in the loss of one ERV for the entire cycle. 1. LER (254/2010-001-00) Electromatic Relief Valve Main Disc Failure -The cause of this ERV failure was determined to be improper torqueing during manufacturing valve assembly. This allowed a gap between the disc retainer and the main disc guide. This failure was in the body of the valve, where our current failure is contained in the valve actuator assembly. G.

This \\nSPAR model includes the following hazards:\\n \\n\\n \\nInternal events,\\n \\n\\n \\nInternal f\\nloods,\\n \\n\\n \\nSeismic,\\n \\n\\n \\nHigh winds, and\\n \\n\\n \\nTornados.\\n \\n3.3\\n \\nSPAR\\n \\nModel Modifications\\n \\nThe following \\nmodification was made to the SPAR model for this analysis:\\n \\n\\n \\nCrediting FLEX Strategies\\n.  The probability of basic event FLX\\n-\\nXHE\\n-\\nXE\\n-\\nELAP \\n(\\noperators fail to declare ELAP when bene\\nficial\\n) was set to its nominal value of 10\\n-\\n2\\n \\nto \\nactivate the credit for FLEX mitigation strategies for postulated SBO scenarios for which \\nan extended loss of AC power (ELAP) is declared.\\n \\nLER 338\\n-\\n2020\\n-\\n001\\n \\n \\n3\\n \\n\\n \\nFLEX Reliability Parameters\\n.  FLEX hardware reliability parameters su\\nitable for inclusion \\nin the NRC SPAR models is not yet available.  Therefore, the base SPAR models \\ncurrently use the reliability parameters of permanently installed equipment, which is \\ninconsistent with the limited experience with the operation of FLEX equ\\nipment.  As part \\nof an NRC audit performed of preliminary FLEX hardware data provided by the \\n\\nreviewed the FLEX hardware parameters estimated by the PWROG.  This review \\nrevealed that\\n \\nFLEX diesel generator failure\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nstart (FTS) probability is 3 to 10\\n \\ntimes \\nhigher and failure\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nrun (FTR) rate is 2 to 5\\n \\ntimes higher than permanently installed \\nEDGs.  The portable engine\\n-\\ndriven centrifugal pump FTS probability is at least 8\\n \\ntimes \\nhigher \\nand FTR rate is at least 6\\n \\ntimes higher than permanently installed pumps.  See \\nTable\\n \\n1 in \\nINL/EXT\\n-\\n20\\n-\\n58327\\n\\n(ADAMS Accession No.\\n \\nML20155K834) for additional information.  Therefore, to provide \\na more representative estimate of the FLEX hardware reliability parameters, this \\nanalysis increased the hardware reliability by a factor of three in the best estimate case.\\n \\n\\n \\nRemoval of EDG Repa\\nir Credit for ELAP Scenarios\\n.  The base SPAR model provides \\ncredit for repair of postulated EDG \\nfailures for SBO scenarios.  However, this potential \\ncredit is not applicable for scenarios where ELAP will be declared because (a.) operators \\nwill be focused o\\nn implementing the FLEX mitigation strategies and (b.) the DC load \\nshedding activities could preclude recovery of EDGs.  Therefore, credit for EDG repair \\ncredit was removed from the sequences if it is included after ELAP is likely declared \\n(i.e.,\\n \\n1\\n \\nhour)\\n.\\n \\n\\n \\n72\\n-\\nHour AC Power Recovery Requirement\\n.  The base SPAR model requires AC power \\nrecovery within 72\\n \\nhours \\nfor a safe/stable end state for ELAP scenarios with successful \\nFLEX implementation.  If AC power is not recovered in these scenarios, the SPAR \\nmodels ass\\nume core damage.  The American Society of Mechanical \\nEngineers/American Nuclear Society probabilistic risk assessment standard definition for \\nsafe/stable end state does not require AC power recovery.  Because of the large \\nuncertainty in modeling assumption\\ns related to availability and reliability of components \\nand strategies for mission times that are well beyond 24 hours and the unclear basis for \\nrequiring AC power recovery within 72\\n \\nhours, the 72\\n-\\nhour AC power requirement was \\neliminated in this analysis\\n. \\n \\nAs part of this change, the FTR events for FLEX diesel \\ngenerators and pumps have a 72\\n-\\nhour mission time in the base SPAR model.  These \\nmission times were reset to be consistent with the 24\\n-\\nhour mission time used in the \\nSPAR model.\\n \\n3.4\\n \\nExposure Time\\n \\nTh\\ne follow\\ning two exposure times were identified for this condition a\\nnalysis\\n:\\n \\n\\n \\nExposure \\nTime 1\\n.\\n  \\nThe licensee concluded that the EDG \\n\\ndegradation occurred \\nduring \\nits start as part of \\nsurveillance testing completed on January 22, 2020\\n.\\n \\n \\nRepairs \\nwere \\ncompleted on February\\n \\n26\\nth\\n \\nafter successful post\\n-\\nmaintenance testing.  \\nTherefore, \\n\\n36\\n \\ndays.  \\nHowever, the failure mechanism could have occurred during any start of the EDG after \\nits\\n \\nsuccessful\\n \\nsurveillance test completed on December 16, 2019\\n, which is\\n \\nan additional \\n37\\n \\ndays.\\n \\nTherefore, \\n\\nfor \\napproximately \\n73\\n \\ndays\\n.  \\nE\\nxposure time \\n1 \\nis \\ncalculated as 1712 hours (i.e., \\n73 days \\nminus the 40 hours\\n \\nfrom exposure time 2\\n)\\n.\\n \\nLER 338\\n-\\n2020\\n-\\n001\\n \\n \\n4\\n \\n\\n \\nExposure Time 2\\n.\\n  \\nBased on the information provided in \\nLER 338\\n-\\n20\\n-\\n001\\n,\\n \\nEDG \\n\\nwas \\ninoperable for normal maintenance and surveillance activities for approximately \\n40\\n \\nhours \\nbetween December 16, 2019 through February 26, 2020\\n.

Expected Submission Date) Abstract (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 14 single-spaced typewritten lines) On February 18, 2020 at approximately 0359, brass shavings were discovered on the upper crankcase of the 1 J \\nEmergency Diesel Generator (EDG) during planned maintenance activities. Maintenance activities further revealed degradation of the number one upper piston pin bushing. The piston pin bushing was replaced. The 1J EDG satisfactorily completed its return to service testing and was restored to operable status on 02/26/2020 at 1925. Investigation into the cause of failure concluded this \\ncondition occurred during the start of the 1J EDG test on 01/22/2020 impacting its ability to meet its 30-day mission time. The 1J EDG was conservatively determined to be inoperable since its last satisfactory test completed on 12/16/2019. Since 12/16/2019, the 1 H EDG was inoperable for normal maintenance and surveillance activities for approximately 39.5 hours. This results in 1 J \\nand 1 H EDG being inoperable concurrently corresponding to an event that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of a system needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident (10 CFR 50. 73(a)(2)(v)(D)). A Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications (T.S.) is also reported due to 1 J \\nEDG inoperability and concurrent inoperability with 1 H EDG greater than T.S. allowed outage times (10 CFR 50. 73(a)(2)(i)(B)). There were no actual safety consequences due to this event. The health and safety of the public were not affected by this event.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER .,, ŁŁŁ~~ North Anna Power Station Unit 1 05000-338 NARRATIVE 1,0 Qescrjptjon of the Event YEAR 2020 Ł SEQUENTIAL NUMBER 001 REV NO. 01 On February 18, 2020 at approximately 0359 with Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 100% power and Unit 2 in Mode 1 at 100% power, brass shavings were discovered on the upper crankcase of the Unit 1 \"J\" (1 J) Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG)(EIIS Component DG, System EK) during planned maintenance activities. Maintenance activities further revealed degradation of the number one upper piston pin bushing. The apparent cause was determined to be a d~gradation of the connecting rod (small end) aluminum cooling oil spherical retainer ring which resulted in increased oil flow and inadequate lubrication between the piston pin and piston pin bushing. Industry operating experience and discussions with Fairbanks Morse (EIIS Manufacturer: F010) , the EDG vendor, determined this to be an isolated failure. As contributor trend analysis of the engine oil copper concentration did not support removal of the EDG from service prior to challenging system functionality. Copper levels in the oil samples of the 1J EDG had been elevated however stayed below all vendor recommended action levels. The 1 J \\nEDG is one of two required EDG capable of supplying the onsite Class 1 E \\npower distribution subsystems for Unit 1. North Anna Unit 2 also has two EDGs. There were no similar indications of copper or other metals present in oil samples from the other EDGs on Unit 1 or Unit 2. The piston pin bushing was replaced along with associated components. The 1J EDG satisfactorily completed its return to service testing and was restored to operable status on 02/26/2020 at 1925. The initiating event that resulted in the degraded number one upper piston pin bushing occurred during the start of the 1 J \\nEDG test on 01/22/2020 impacting its ability to meet its 30-day mission time. A prior operability assessment determined the 1 J \\nEDG to have been inoperable since its last satisfactory surveillance test conducted on 12/16/2019. This determination of inoperability of 1 J \\nEDG results in a Condition Prohibited by Technical Specification (T.S.) specifically T.S. 3.8.1 Condition B for an allowed completion time of 14 days to restore the EDG to operable status (10 CFR 50. 73(a)(2)(i} (B)). Since 12/16/2019, the 1 H \\nEDG was inoperable for normal maintenance and surveillance activities for approximately 39.5 hours.

Expected Submission Date) No Abstract (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 14 single-spaced typewritten lines) At 2144 [EST] on 11/20/2019, with Unit 2 at 100 percent power, all three (3) Unit 2 Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) pumps were declared inoperable due to the Unit 2 Turbine Driven (TD) AFW pump discharge check valve failing to completely close, which caused flow from a running Unit 2 Motor Driven (MD) AFW to partially recirculate back to the Emergency Condensate Storage Tank. At 2203 the two (2) MDAFW pumps were declared operable after the discharge isolation valves for the TDAFW pump were closed. The Unit 2 TDAFW discharge check valve condition existed from 10/28/19 to 11 /20/19 and could have adversely impacted the ability of AFW to function properly. The cause of this event was determined to be excessive wear on the discharge check valve disc assembly parts causing the disc to stick partially open. The safety consequences associated with this event are bounded by the safety analyses documented in UFSAR Chapter 14. The affected check valve's internal assembly parts were replaced. To prevent recurrence, a corrective action is planned to periodically inspect and/or replace the check valve internals, as needed, on both units. Unit 1 \\nwas not impacted by this event since it was in cold shutdown at the time.

Plant Operation Conditions Before the Event Event Date: 11/20/2019 Unit 1: 0 Percent Power (Cold Shutdown) Unit 2: 100 Percent Power Background: The Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) system [EIIS: BA] is a safety-related system except for the initiating signals of the reactor coo.lant [EIIS: AC] buses undervoltage feature, the main feedwater pump [EIIS: SJ-P] breaker trip feature, the loss of reserve station power feature, and the AMSAC feature. The initiating circuitry incorporates both automatic ar:i&lt;tl manual system start capability, including manual initiation of the system from the control room. · ,, The AFW system consists principally of one (1) 100 percent capacity Turbine-Driven Auxiliary Fee&lt;fjwater (TDAFW) pump [EIIS: BA-P] rated for 700 gpm, two (2) 50 percent capacity Motor-Driven Auxiliary Feedwater (MDAFW) pumps [EIIS: P] rated for 350 gpm, a 110,000-gallon storage tank, and associated piping, valves, and controls. The turbine-driven pump and the electrically-driven pumps represent two diverse pumping systems that operate \\nautomatically to supply auxiliary feedwater to the steam generators. These three (3) pumps are in parallel and provide flow to two common discharge headers. The discharge line of each pump contains a discharge check valve [EIIS: BA-VJ horizontally mounted . downstream of each AFW pump. 1hese check valves are a Critical Class 1 component which are tested open every quarter and tested to close every refueling outage in accordance with the 1ST program. Additionally, the Units 1 and 2 AFW systems can be cross-tied to ensure that in the event of a postulated high energy line break in the Main Steam Vaive House or a fire that disables the auxiliary feedwater pumps, the unaffected system will have the ability of maintaining both units in a hot shutdown condition. · B. Description of Event: On 11/20/2019, an AFW cross-tie capability test from Unit 2 to Unit 1 was performed. For the test, the Unit 2 \"B\" MDAFW pump was started to pressurize the AFW discharge header. Rather than closing the manual isolation valves, isolation of the other Unit 2 MDAFW and TDAFW pumps was accomplished by crediting each pump's discharge check valve. The purpose of this action was to prevent having to declare all the Unit 2 AFW pumps inoperable while running the test. Shortly after the Unit 2 ''B\" MDAi=W pump was started, an operator in the field reported the Unit 2 TDAFW pump was turning backwards. This allowed flow from the running Unit 2 MDAFW pump to partially recirculate back to the Emergency Condensate Storage Tank. As a result, all three (3) Unit 2 AFW pumps were declared inoperable. After isolating the discharge check valve, both Unit 2 MDAFW pumps were declared operable. Unit 2 remained in a 72-hour Technical Specification action statement to restore the Unit 2 TDAFW pump. Troubleshooting determined that the backward rotation had been caused by the Unit 2 TDAFW pump discharge check valve that had not fully closed. It was concluded that the discharge check valve failing to completely close occurred during the performance of the last quarterly Unit 2 TDAFW pump flow surveillance test on 10/28/2019 and that between 10/28/2019 and 11/20/2019 this condition could have prevented the Unit 2 AFW System from functioning properly; consequently, this report is being submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50. 73 (a)(2)(v)(B), as an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function of SSCs needed to remove residual heat.

I YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV ~-I 002 1-~ NARRATIVE Additionally, because the pumps were determined to be inoperable longer than allowed by Technical Specification 3.6.F, this report is also being submitted pursuant to 1 O \\nCFR 50.73 (a)(2)(i)(B), as any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications. C. Cause of Event: The direct cause of the check valve failure was due to excessive wear on the check valve disc assembly parts. The internal valve assembly for this valve was last replaced in 1993. The root cause was that no scheduled preventative maintenance was being performed on the Unit 2 TDAFW pump discharge check valve due to decisions made in 1996 and 2005 to rely on back leakage checks vs. performing check valve open and inspect. As a result, the station was not monitoring the extent of the wear occurring on the valve internals. D. Safety Consequences The safety consequences of postulated accident scenarios rely on the availability of the AFW system to provide water to the steam generators for the purpose of removing core decay heat during and after the postulated accident scenarios. Limiting analysis assumptions for evaluation of such scenarios include a loss of offsite power rendering the Main Feedwater (MFW) pumps unavailable. For the \\nduration of the Unit 2 AFW system unavailability period in question, Surry Power Station retained offsite power. This ensured that the Unit 2 MFW system was available as an alternate method of providing water to the steam generators and, therefore, ensuring a source of secondary coolant. -; A review of station logs identified that, if the Unit 2 MFW system were unavailable for any reason, additional depth was provided by the station cross-tie piping. Using this piping, at least one (1) Unit 1 motor driven AFW pump was available to provide water to the Unit 2 steam generators for all but five (5) hours of the period in question, when the cross-tie was unavailable for testing on 11/15/2019. During this five (5) hours of unavailability, it is estimated that the capability to resupply water to Unit 2 would have taken less than 1 hour if needed. Further, isolation of the unanalyzed flow path through the Unit 2 TDAFW pump discharge line, which restored the operability of the Unit 2 AFW system, was completed within 20 minutes of identifying the Unit 2 TDAFW pump was rotating backward on 11/20/2019. This demonstrates that operability of the Unit 2 AFW system could have been promptly restored in response to an actual event. Consequently, the safety consequences associated with this event were bounded by the safety analyses documented in UFSAR Chapter 14. Risk Significance: The initiating events most challenging for this event are Emergency Switchgear Room (ESGR) floods and plant transients. ESGR floods have the potential to disable all emergency power, leaving only the Unit 1 or 2 TDAFW pumps to provide secondary cooling. Plant transients typically rely on AFW as the primary source of decay heat removal, so a challenge to AFW would require operators to either align the Auxiliary Feedwater cross-tie, Main Feedwater, Condensate, or use feed and bleed for decay heat removal.

On March 9, 2019, \\nthe Unit\\n 3 automatic\\nally scrammed due to \\na turbine \\nload reject. \\n The automatic \\nscram was cause\\nd when a l\\nicensed \\nreactor \\noperator lower\\ned incoming reactive power\\n at the request of grid operators\\n.  The \\noperator\\n incorrectly \\nmanipulated \\na hand switch \\nby \\nchang\\ning \\nthe automatic voltage regulator from \\nautomatic\\n to manual. \\n In this \\nmode of operation, the dynamic limiter is\\n removed, which allows \\noperators \\nto adjust \\nmega volt \\namps \\nreactive beyond the \\nunder-excitation \\nlimiter protection setting. \\n As a result, the \\nmain \\ngenerator circuit breaker tripped causi\\nng a turbine\\n load reject and \\nsubsequent\\n automatic\\n scram\\n.  All safety systems actuated as designed.\\n  Specifically, all\\n four Unit\\n 3 EDGs \\nstarted and loaded \\nonto their respective 4\\n-kV \\nshutdown \\nboards \\n(per design)\\n.  In addition, \\nHPCI and RCIC initiated \\non low \\nreactor\\n water level\\n and successfully provided inventory makeup to the reactor\\n.  The licensee declared an \\nNOUE due to \\nloss of the 500\\n-kV offsite power source.  \\nAdditional \\ninformation is provided in \\nlicensee event report (LER)\\n 296-2019-001-01 (Ref.\\n 1). Cause.\\n  This event was \\ndirect\\nly cause\\nd by a reactor operator \\nincorrectly\\n manipulating \\na hand switch \\nby \\nchang\\ning\\n the voltage regulator from auto\\nmatic\\n to manual.\\n  The licensee determined \\nthat root cause of this event was the operations department \\nallow\\ning\\n continued negative human \\nperformance behaviors by inconsistently\\n providing \\nreinforcement\\n on the use of appropriate \\nhuman performance\\n barriers\\n. MODELING \\n             SDP Results/\\nBasis for ASP Analysis\\n.  The ASP Program performs independent analyses for \\ninitiating events.  ASP analyses of initiating events account for all failures/degraded conditions \\nand unavailabilities (e.g.,\\n equipment out for test/maintenance) th\\nat occurred during the event, \\nregardless of licensee performance.\\n1  Additional LERs were reviewed to determine if concurrent \\nunavailabilities existed during the \\nMarch\\n 9th event\\n.  No windowed events or concurrent \\ndegraded operating conditions were \\nidentified\\n.  Discussions with Region 2 staff indicate that a \\npreliminary \\nlicensee performance deficiency \\nassociated with this event \\nhas been identified; \\nhowever, the \\nevaluation has not completed and the \\nLER remains open.\\n Analysis Type.\\n  An initiating event\\n analysis was performed \\nusing the \\nRevision\\n 8.62 standardized plant analysis risk (\\nSPAR\\n) model\\n for \\nBrowns Ferry\\n Nuclear Plant (Unit\\n 3) create\\nd in \\nJune\\n 2019.  This event was modeled as a \\nswitchyard\\n-centered LOOP initiating event\\n. Key Modeling Assumptions\\n.  The following modeling assumptions were determined to be \\nsignificant to the modeling of this initiating event assessment:\\n  The probability of IE\\n-LOOPSC\\n (loss of \\noffsite power (switchyard\\n-centered\\n)) was set to \\n1.0 due to the \\nloss of offsite power caused by\\n the turbine load reject\\n.  All other initiating \\nevent probabilities were set to zero.\\n  The probability of b\\nasic event FLX\\n-XHE\\n-XM-ELAP\\n was set to \\na screening value of 0.1\\n to activate the credit for FLEX mitigation strategies for \\npostulated \\nstation blackout \\n(SBO) \\n                                                 1  ASP analyses also account for any degraded condition(s) identified after the initiating event occurred, if the \\nfailure/degradation exposure period(s) overlapped the initiating event date.\\n LER \\n296-2019-001-01   3 scenarios\\n for which an extended loss of \\nAC power (ELAP) is declared.\\n2  Sensitivity \\nanalyses show that any further refinement of these human error probabilities\\n (HEPs)\\n has \\na negligible\\n impact on the results of this analysis.\\n  Offsite Power Recovery\\n.  Offsite power was restored \\nfrom 500\\n-kV offsite power source \\nto the 4-kV \\nshutdown \\nboards\\n approximately 14 hours after the LOOP \\ninitiated.  \\nHowever, \\nthe alternate 161\\n-kV offsite power source remained available throughout the event.  \\nAlthough this alternate o\\nffsite power source was supplying Unit\\n 2 during \\nan outage, it is \\nestimated that \\noperators could have aligned this source to at least one of the Unit\\n 3 4-kV \\nshutdown boards within an hour.\\n Œ Basic event OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR30MSC (\\noperators \\nfail to \\nrecover \\noffsite \\npower in \\n30 minutes\\n) was set to TRUE given the uncertainties associated with operators being \\nable to align the 161\\n-kV offsite power source to a Unit 3 4\\n-kV shutdown\\n board within \\n30 minutes.  Although this assumption is potential conservative, sensitivity an\\nalyses \\nshow this assumption has a negligible effect on the analysis results.\\n Œ Basic events \\nOEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR01HSC (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in \\n1 hour), OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR02HSC (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in \\n2 hours\\n), OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR04HSC (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in \\n4 hours\\n), OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR10HSC (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in \\n10 hours\\n), and OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR12HSC (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in \\n12 hours\\n) were \\nevaluated using the \\nSPAR-H Human Reliability An\\nalysis Method (\\nRef.\\n 2 and Ref\\n 3).  The HEPs were calculated to be 4×10\\n-2 for \\nOEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR01HSC\\n and \\n10-3 for \\nOEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR02HSC\\n, OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR04HSC, OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR10HSC\\n, and OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR12HSC\\n.  See \\nAppendix B\\n for additional information on \\nthis \\nevaluation\\n. ANALYSIS RESULTS \\n           CCDP.  The conditional CCDP for this analysis is calculated to be \\n3.2×10-6.  The ASP Program \\nacceptance threshold is a CCDP of 1×10\\n-6 or the CCDP equivalent of an uncomplicated reactor \\ntrip with a non\\n-recoverable loss of feed water or the condenser heat sink), whichever is greater.  \\nThis CCDP equivalent for \\nBrowns Ferry Nuc\\nlear Plant\\n (Unit\\n 3) is \\n2.7×10-6.3  Therefore, this \\nevent is a \\nprecursor\\n.

Expected Submission Date Abstract (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 14 single-spaced typewritten lines) On March 9, 2019, at approximately 2259 Central Standard Time (CST), Browns Ferry Unit 3 received an automatic Reactor SCRAM from 100 percent power as a result of a Turbine Load Reject. Browns Ferry Unit 3 declared a Notification of Unusual Event due to loss of the 500kV offsite source. The automatic SCRAM occurred as a Licensed Reactor Operator (LRO) made adjustments to lower incoming reactive power on Unit 3 at the request of the Balancing Authority. The LRO incorrectly operated a hand switch and changed the automatic voltage regulator (AVR) from auto to manual. In this mode of operation, the dynamic limiter is removed, which allows Operations personnel to adjust Mega Volt Amps Reactive (MVAR) beyond the Under Excitation Limiter (UEL) protection setting. As a result, the generator circuit breaker tripped causing a Turbine Load reject and an automatic SCRAM. All safety systems actuated as designed. The root cause for this event was determined to be that Operations department leaders have allowed continued negative human performance (HU) behaviors by inconsistently providing coaching or reinforcing the use of appropriate HU barriers. The corrective action to prevent recurrence is to revise the Operations Excellence Program, BFN-ODM-4.28, to require use of a dynamic learning environment to develop Operations Department Leaders' skills in coaching and reinforcing the use of appropriate HU barriers. Training will be required prior to assuming shift following initial qualification as Nuclear Unit Senior Operators (NUSO) and Shift Managers (SM). The currently qualified NUSOs and SMs have received training. A plastic cover was placed over the manual/auto select voltage regulator hand switch on all three Units to mitigate unintentional operation of the AVR from automatic to manual control. The Operating Instruction procedure for the Turbine Generator System was revised to prompt Operations personnel to validate the initial status of the AVR prior to adjusting MVAR.

Event Summary 001 On March 9, 2019, at approximately 2259 Central Standard Time (CST), Browns Ferry Unit 3 received an automatic Reactor SCRAM from 100 percent power as a result of a Turbine [TRB] Load Reject. The automatic SCRAM occurred as a Licensed Reactor Operator (LRO) made adjustments to lower incoming reactive power on Unit 3 at the request of the Balancing Authority (BA). The request was made by the BA to address a high voltage condition on the 500kV transmission system. During the adjustment, a LRO incorrectly operated a hand switch [HS], placing the Automatic Voltage Regulator [RG] (AVR) in manual control, and adjusted Mega Volt Amps Reactive (MVAR) beyond the Under Excitation [EXC] Limiter (UEL) protection setting. After two seconds, the generator excitation remained below the protection setting, which initiated a loss of excitation trip resulting in loss of the generator exciter field. Incoming MVAR and current increased on all three generator phases resulting in actuation of generator overcurrent protective relays [RL Y] and opening of the Unit 3 high-side breakers [BKR]. The generator circuit breaker tripped causing a Turbine Load Reject and automatic SCRAM. Systems that actuated as a result of the automatic SCRAM include those listed in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). Primary Containment Isolation Systems [JE] (PCIS) Groups 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 isolation signals were received. High Pressure Coolant Injection [BG] (HPCI) and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling [BN] (RCIC) initiated on low reactor water level. All four Unit 3 Diesel Generators [EK][DG] (DGs) started and loaded as expected and supplied AC power to their respective 4kV Shutdown Boards as designed. Browns Ferry Unit 3 declared a Notification of Unusual Event (NOUE) due to loss of the 500kV offsite source. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is submitting this report in accordance with Title 10 CFR 50. 73(a)(2)(iv)(A), as any event or condition that resulted in a manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B). B. Status of structures, components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event and that contributed to the event There were no structures, systems, or components (SSCs) whose inoperability contributed to this event. 01 NRC FORM 366A (04-2018) Page _2_ of _5_ NRC FORM 366A (04-2017)) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION m ___ t:IT UMts: NU.

Analysis of the event The voltage regulator manual/auto select hand switch was operated incorrectly, thereby swapping the AVR from automatic to manual control mode. In this mode of operation, the dynamic limiter is removed, which allows Operations personnel to adjust MVAR below the UEL. The dynamic protection setpoint (10 percent protection limit) remains active when in manual mode. After reaching the setpoint of the 10 percent protection limit, the AVR swapped active channels. Seconds later, with MVAR still below the limit, the AVR tripped the exciter circuit breaker. As excitation lowered, the generator began to reverse power, resulting in the Turbine trip and automatic reactor SCRAM. V. Assessment of Safety Consequences 01 This event resulted in the automatic actuation of safety systems. This event did not result in the inoperability or unavailability of any system to provide their required safety functions. Therefore, this condition was of low safety significance and had negligible impact on the health and safety of the public. A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the components and systems that failed during the event No systems or components failed during this event. B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions, remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the consequences of an accident This event did not occur when the reactor was shutdown. C. For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, estimate of the elapsed time from discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service Safety system availability was not impacted by this event. VI. Corrective Actions Corrective Actions are being managed by TVA's Corrective Action Program (CAP) under Condition Report 1497448. A. Immediate Corrective Actions Ł A plastic cover was installed over the manual/auto select voltage regulator hand switch [HS] on Units 1, 2, and 3 to mitigate unintentional operation of the AVR from automatic to manual control. Ł NRC FORM 366A (04-2018) Units 1, 2, and 3 Operating Instruction procedure for the Turbine Generator System, was revised to prompt Operators to validate the initial status of the AVR prior to adjusting MVAR.

Expected Submission Date Abstract (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 14 single-spaced typewritten lines) On 6/13/18, during a surveillance test of the E-3 Emergency Diesel Generator, higher than normal engine temperatures were noted and abnormal noises were heard while running the engine at full load. The engine was shut down and troubleshooting initiated. Inspection of the turbocharger air inlet check valve discovered a pin used to hold the check valve disc in place was missing. The pin had become dislodged and had traveled to the turbocharger, where it caused damage to the rotating blades of the turbocharger. Repairs were performed and the diesel generator was placed back in service on 6/23/18. Investigation of the failure determined that inadequate repairs during maintenance in April 2017 resulted in the pin loosening at certain engine loads. This event is being reported as required by 1 OCFR 50.73(a)(2)(i}(B}.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER YEAR Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station Unit 2 05000277 2018 -NARRATIVE Unit Conditions Prior to the Event SEQUENTIAL NUMBER 002 REV NO. -01 Unit 2 and Unit 3 were both operating in Mode 1 at approximately 100% rated thermal power. There were no structures, systems or components out of service that contributed to this event. Description of Event On 6/13/18, a periodic surveillance test was being performed on the E-3 Emergency Diesel Generator (EOG). The test is performed to verify the EOG can slow start and run at full load for at least one hour. The EDG was started and after approximately 40 minutes, brought up to full load (2700 -2800 kW). After approximately 30 minutes of operating at full load, temperature readings indicated higher than normal exhaust temperatures at several locations. After further observation and indications of higher than normal operating temperatures, the decision was made to shut down the engine. As the EDG was being shutdown, a rattling noise was heard in the area of the turbocharger. The EDG operated at full load for approximately 55 minutes. Troubleshooting centered around the turbocharger air inlet check valve, which allows for an increased flow of air to the turbocharger air inlet as the load on the engine increases. Inspection identified a pin used to hold the check valve disk to the pivot shaft was missing and had entered the air inlet piping. Air intake for the engine's two turbochargers is initially through a common pipe, which splits to direct air to each turbocharger. The dislodged pin bounced between the two turbochargers, causing damage to the aluminum turbocharger blades. The damage resulted in aluminum particles being distributed through the air intake, lube oil and exhaust systems. Aluminum particles were also found in the cylinders of the engine. Larger aluminum particles were caught in the intercooler fins. Repairs included replacing the air inlet check valve, replacing the turbochargers, removing larger particles of the impeller blades from the intercooler inlet, cleaning the cylinder liners, replacing piston rings and flushing the lubricating oil system. Post maintenance testing was performed, and the diesel generator was placed back in service on 6/23/18. Analysis of Event The onsite standby power source for the four 4 kV emergency buses in each unit consists of four EDGs. Each EOG can supply power to two 4 kV buses, one for each unit. Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.1, Condition B, provides required actions when one EDG is inoperable. These actions include determining that the remaining EDGs are not inoperable due to a common cause failure and restoring the EOG to an operable status within 14 days. The pin that had become dislodged from the E-3 EOG air inlet check valve had been replaced during preventive maintenance performed in April 2017. The pin was manufactured on site and was unique to the NRC FORM 366A (04-2018) Page _2_ of _.L..

The air inlet check valves for the three remaining EOGs were inspected with no concerns identified. All three EOGs remained operable while E-3 was being repaired. REV NO. 01 Repairs were completed, post-maintenance testing performed and the E-3 EOG was declared operable at 7:1 O pm on 6/23/18. As a result of this event, the E-3 EOG was inoperable for repairs for approximately 9 days, 21 hours. The previous surveillance test was performed on 5/20/18, 24 days prior to the failed surveillance on 6/13/18. Analysis determined the E-3 EOG may not have been able to perform its design function for the seven day mission time since April 2017, prior to the preventive maintenance activities that replaced the pin. As a result, the E-3 EOG is considered to have been inoperable for a total of approximately 443 days. This exceeds the TS 3.8.1 allowed outage time of 14 days. As a result, this event is being reported in accordance with 1 OCFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), for any operation or condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. There were no actual safety consequences as a result of this event. The plant's safety analysis assumes one EOG is unavailable. If a design basis event had occurred during the time the E-3 EOG was inoperable, the units could have been safely shutdown with the three remaining EOGs. Cause of the Event The cause was determined to be less than adequate repairs to the air inlet check valve during maintenance performed in April of 2017. Several causal factors existed, including shaft bushing wear and inadequate shaft to disk fit, which resulted in higher vibration of the shaft and disk. With the higher vibration, tolerances for the interference fit of the pin to the disk shaft were not adequate to prevent the pin from becoming dislodged. Corrective Actions The valve disk, shaft and bushings were replaced and repairs to the EOG were performed as described above. Additional causal factors and corrective actions are documented in the corrective action program. Previous Similar Occurrences No previous similar occurrences have been identified.

This action was taken because the RCIC system turbine-pump did not achieve the acceptance criteria of flow rate, discharge pressure, and speed during the performance of a surveillance test. Due to the unexpected response \\na Failure Modes Analysis was initiated to determine the cause. No deficient conditions were identified during troubleshooting. However, based on the investigation, the team determined that the direct cause was output signal loss from the RCIC flow controller. A spare calibrated controller was installed, the system was tested, and successfully returned to service. The High Pressure Coolant Injection system was operable and capable of providing high pressure core cooling similar to the RCIC system. This event had no impact on the health and/or safety of the public. This report is submitted in accordance with Title 1 O Code of Federal Regulations 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D).

FACILITYNAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LEA NUMBER YEAR Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station 05000-293 2019 NARRATIVE BACKGROUND SEQUENTIAL NUMBER -001 REV NO. -00 The Pilgrim Station Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) states that the Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) system is designed to provide makeup water to the reactor vessel following reactor isolation in order to prevent the release of radioactive materials to the environment as a result of inadequate reactor core cooling. The system consists of a steam driven turbine-pump and associated valves and piping capable of delivering makeup water to the reactor vessel over a range of reactor pressures. The system can be operated automatically or manually, and is one of the systems credited in the UFSAR for a design basis Control Rod Drop Accident (CRDA). The RCIC system is sufficient to maintain reactor \\nvessel water level at an acceptable limit during \\nthis event. EVENT DESCRIPTION On January 8, 2019, the RCIC turbine was started in automatic from the main control room per a quarterly ~urveillance. During the test run, the turbine did not reach rated conditions. Operators identified that flow controller, FIC-1340-01, output meter was indicating zero, which was unexpected. Operators attempted to change demand by varying the flow controller setpoint from 375 gallons per minute (gpm) to 425 gpm, but no change in output or flow occurred. Operators then manually stopped the RCIC turbine from the main control room and declared the RCIC system inoperable. rrhe NRG Operations Center was notified of the event in accordance with Title 1 O Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 50. 72 at 1545 hours on January 8, 2019. The event occurred during power operation while at 100 percent reactor power. The reactor mode selector switch was in the RUN position. CAUSE OF THE EVENT Due to the unexpected response a Failure Modes Analysis was initiated to investigate the cause. No deficient conditions were identified during troubleshooting. However, based on the investigation, the team determined that the direct cause was output signal loss from RCIC flow controller FIC-1340-01. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS rrhe installed flow controller was removed and replaced with a spare calibrated controller. An operability test run was completed and the system was successfully returned to service. ~ny further corrective actions will be documented in the corrective action program.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER YEAR Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station 05000-293 2019 SAFETY CONSEQUENCES SEQUENTIAL NUMBER -001 REV NO. -00 The RCIC system function is to provide high pressure makeup water to the reactor vessel after isolation of the vessel. The RCIC and High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) systems provide Single-Failure Proof response to high pressure reactor vessel injection following a CRDA. The HPCI system was operable while the RCIC system was inoperable. If the HPCI system were to become inoperable and core cooling was necessary, the automatic depressurization system would depressurize the reactor in order to allow low pressure core cooling by the residual heat removal system (low pressure coolant injection mode), and/or core spray system. There were no actual consequences to safety of the general public, nuclear safety, industrial safety, or radiological safety for this event based on the availability of appropriate high pressure core cooling. REPORT ABILITY The condition is reportable under 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73 based on NUREG-1022 guidance as a condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function because the RCIC system was inoperable as defined in the Technical Specifications. However, the condition is not a safety system functional failure because an engineering evaluation concluded that the safety function would have been fulfilled by HPCI, if high pressure core cooling were needed. HPCI was operable at the time that RCIC failed to meet it surveillance requirements and was declared inoperable.

Cook \\nNuclear Plant\\ns 1 and 2 created \\nin December \\n2020.  This \\nTLU model includes an \\ninadver\\ntent SI actuation \\nevent\\n tree to allow the modeling of this \\nevent\\n. 3.3 SPAR Model Modifications\\n The following SPAR model modifications were made to support this analysis:\\n  The event tree branch for th\\ne ISINJ (\\ninadvertent SI\\n) event tree was modified.  \\nSpecifically, the transfers to the \\nSLOCA (\\nsmall LOCA\\n) event tree were removed \\nand replace\\nd by branching within the parent event tree.\\n  These changes eliminate \\nunnecessary queries in the SLOCA event tree.  \\nIn addition, the\\n OEP (\\nconsequential loss \\nof offsite power\\n) top event\\n and transfer to the \\nLOOPPC (\\nplant\\n-centered loss of offsite \\npower\\n) event tree was inserted\\n to account for potential consequential LOOP during the \\nevent\\n.  The transfer for the failure of the reactor protection sys\\ntem sequence was \\n 1  ASP analyses also \\naccount for any degraded condition(s) that were identified after the initiating event occurred if\\n the failure/degradation exposure \\ntime\\n(s) overlapped the initiating event date.\\n LER \\n316-2020-003  3 changed\\n to the ATWS (\\nanticipated transient without scram\\n) event tree.  The modified \\nISINJ \\nevent tree is \\nprovided in \\nFigure\\n A-1 of Appendix\\n A.

All other \\ninitiating event probabilities were set to zero.\\n  Basic event\\n PPR-PRV\\n-CO-TRANS \\nwas set to TRUE because the PORVs opened s\\neven\\n times during the event response.\\n  The pressurizer PORVs \\nexperience \\nseven\\n demands\\n due to high RCS pressure as a \\nresult of the SI a\\nctu\\nation.  T\\no account for the increased failure of these \\nPORVs\\n to successfully reclose after the opening, the associated failure probabilities were modified \\nusing binominal expansion to account for their greater likelihood of failure.  Basic event\\n ZT-PRV-OO-PZR-R1 (one pressurizer PORV fails to reclose after scram\\n) was\\n set to \\n1×10-2. 4 ANALYSIS RESULTS \\n  4.1 Results\\n The mean\\n CCDP \\nfor this analysis is calculated to be \\n1×10-5.  The ASP Program threshold \\nfor \\ninitiating events \\nis a CCDP of \\n10-6 or the \\nplant\\n-specific \\nCCDP of an uncomplicated reactor trip \\nwith a non\\n-recoverable loss of feedwater or the condenser heat sink, whichever is greater. \\n This \\nCCDP equivalent for \\nD.C.

1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\n   On August\\n 10, 2020, severe thunderstorms and high winds caused a grid perturbation that \\nresulted in an automatic start of both emergency diesel generators (EDGs).  The EDG\\ns did not \\nimmediately \\nenergize\\n their respective safety buses beca\\nuse offsite power remained available.  \\nHowever, approximately \\n14 minutes later, \\na loss of \\noffsite power\\n (LOOP)\\n occurred that resulted \\nin a reactor trip.  The output breakers for both EDGs automatically closed to reenergize the \\nsafety buses. \\n The licensee d\\neclared a\\nn Unusual Event.  All control rods successfully inserted.  \\nReactor inventory control was maintained by reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) and the \\nsafety relief valves (SRVs) were used to remove decay heat to the torus.\\n The high winds resulted in minor damage to \\nthe \\nreactor, turbine, and FLEX building\\ns, along with \\nmore severe damage to the nonsafety\\n-related cooling towers.  \\nThe licensee later determined \\nthat, although damaged, secondary containment remained functional thr\\noughout the event and \\nif challenged, would have prevented a radiological release to the environment.  However, when \\n\\ntested, the vacuum drawn in secondary containment by the standby gas treatment system was \\nslightly below the technical specification\\n (TS)\\n limit.\\n In addition, t\\nhe high winds result\\ned in increase\\nd debris loading to the essential service water \\n(ESW) system, which cause\\nd clogging of the train\\n ‚B™ strainer\\n and subsequent decrease of ESW \\nflow of 300\\n gpm to EDG\\n ‚B™\\n.  Operators successfully bypassed t\\nhe strainer\\n.  The train ‚A™ \\nstrainer was also challenged due to debris during the event; however, the differential pressure \\n\\nacross the strainer reached a maximum of 11\\n psid, which is below the limit of 15\\n psid and, \\ntherefore,\\n did not require to be bypassed\\n.  Although the operators declared\\n EDG ‚B™ \\ninoperable\\n according to TS, i\\nt did not experience any problems due to the use of unstrained ESW\\n and ran \\nsuccessfully through\\nout the event\\n.  Operators restored offsite power to the safety buses \\napproximately 25\\n hours after the LOOP \\noccurred\\n. This accident sequence precursor (ASP) analysis reveals that the most likely core damage \\nsequence is a \\nweather\\n-related \\nLOOP initiating event and the subsequent \\n(postulated) \\nfailure of \\nboth EDGs resulting in a station blackout \\n(SBO)\\n with the postulated failure\\ns of both \\nhigh\\n-pressure coolant injection (\\nHPCI\\n) and RCIC and \\nthe \\ninability of \\noperators \\nto \\nrecover alternating \\ncurrent (AC) \\npower \\nwithin 30\\n minutes\\n.  This accident seque\\nnce accounts for approximately \\n35 percent of the total conditional core damage probability (CCDP) for this event.\\n  Although the \\nLER 331\\n-2020-001   2 mean \\nCCDP \\nof \\n8×10\\n-4 for this event \\nwas high\\n, the risk \\nof core damage was mitigated\\n because \\ndefense\\n-in-depth and plant\\n-wide safet\\ny margins were maintained.\\n FLEX mitigation strategies were credited in this analysis\\n and significantly \\naffected the results.  \\nSpecifically, \\nwithout \\nthe mitigation capabilities of the \\nFLEX strategies \\nwould have \\nresult\\ned in a \\nCCDP approximately\\n a factor of \\n10 higher for \\nthis event\\n.  Throughout the review\\n of this event\\n, the analysis \\nassumptions and\\n results were systematically review\\ned to identify necessary \\nstandardized plant analysis risk (\\nSPAR) model changes \\nthat \\nwere \\nimplemented\\n to realisticall\\ny represent the event \\nand expected plant response.  In addition, \\nanalysis \\nresults were al\\nso use\\nd to identify key sources of uncertainty\\n. The risk of this event was significantly impacted by the \\nSBO scenarios. \\n The risk associated with \\nthe SBO scenarios is \\nparticularly high for this plant because\\n of having \\nonly two \\nsafety\\n-related \\nEDGs\\n and \\nthe in\\nability to crosstie safety\\n-related buses\\n from another unit\\n as Duane Arnold is a \\nsingle unit site\\n. 2 EVENT DETAILS \\n  2.1\\n Event Description\\n On August\\n 10, 2020, \\nsevere thunder\\nstorms and high winds caused a grid \\nperturbation that \\nresulted in an automatic start of both \\nEDGs.\\n  The EDG did not immediately \\nenergize\\n their \\nrespective safety buses because\\n offsite power remained available.

The main steam isolation valves (MSIVs) remained open throughout the event.  During \\nmost LOOPs, the MSIVs will close due to the loss\\n of power from the reactor protection \\nsystem (RPS) motor generators.  However, the starting of the EDGs due to the grid \\n\\nperturbation prior to the LOOP allowed for a faster reenergization of the safety \\nbuses \\nprior\\n to the voltage from RPS motor generators \\ndecre\\nasing \\nbelow the value that would \\nresult in a loss of power to the MSIVs.  Because the MSIVs remained open, operators \\naligned the main steam line\\n (MSL)\\n drains\\n to the condenser\\n, which \\nminimized the number \\nof demands on the reactor \\nSRVs \\n(two SRVs each cycled \\nopen and closed one \\ntime\\n).  The current SPAR models use a failure\\n-to-close probability for SRVs of 9.6×10\\n-2 taken \\nfrom \\nNUREG\\n-1150, ﬁSevere Accident Risks: An Assessment for Five U.S. \\nNuclear \\nPower Plants\\n,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML120960691)\\n.  This probability \\naccounts for \\nmultiple SRV demands\\n; therefore, this probability was not changed given the two \\ndemands experienced during the event and the expected additional demands during a \\npostu\\nlated SBO in which the MSIVs would close.\\n  NUREG/CR\\n-7037, ﬁIndustry \\nPerformance of Relief Valves at U.S. Commercial Nuclear Power Plants through 2007,ﬂ\\n (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML110980205\\n) has an\\n updated reliability estimate; however, the \\nLER 331\\n-2020-001   4 adequacy of SRV testing that is included in these estimates has come into question.  \\nSpecifically, \\ntesting is \\nperformed \\nto demonstrate that the SRVs will open to relieve \\npressure during design\\n-basis accidents to \\nprevent overpressure of the reactor coolant \\nsystem.  However, the closing capability \\nof SRVs \\nis not tested \\nafter passing \\nsteam\\n.  In \\naddition, there \\nare\\n concerns about the demand data used in the stuck\\n-open SRV \\nprobability provided in \\nNUREG/CR\\n-7037.  The probability taken from \\nNUREG\\n-1150 is \\npotentially\\n conservative\\n; however, t\\nhe effect of the stuck\\n-open SRV probability on this \\nanaly\\nsis is largely mitigated by the credit of the di\\nesel\\n-driven firewater pump and FLEX \\nRPV makeup pumps for these scenarios\\n.  During the event, the running spent fuel pool (SFP) cooling pump ‚A™ tripped.  Operators \\nimmediately started SFP cooling pump ‚B™.\\n  Prior to the event, the licensee was loading fuel into a spent fuel canister. \\n These fuel \\nmoves were stopped prior to the storms affecting the site; the fuel and canister were \\nplace\\nd in a safe condition within the SFP.\\n  On August 12, a small \\ntear\\n was discov\\nered in the \\n5th floor wall of the r\\neactor \\nbuilding\\n that \\nwas the result of storm damage. \\n A subsequent \\ntest of the \\nsecondary \\ncontainment \\nboundary \\nidentified that the vacuum of \\n0.24 inches of water\\n was \\nless that the t\\nechnical \\nspecification \\nrequirement \\nof 0.25 inches of water. \\n At the time of discovery, the plant was\\n is in Mode 4, which does not require s\\necondary \\ncontainment \\nto be operable\\n.  However, \\nit \\nis very likely that \\nthe \\ntear\\n in the \\nreactor \\nbuilding wall likely existed \\nwhile the \\nplant wa\\ns in \\nMode 3\\n after the \\nreactor scram and, therefore, se\\ncondary \\ncontainment \\nwas inoperable \\nduring this period\\n.  Although considered inoperable, the licensee determined that a \\nvacuum of \\n0.24 inches of water was sufficient to \\nmaintain \\nthe safety function of \\nsecondary containment\\n. 3 MODELING \\n  3.1\\n Basis for ASP Analysis\\n The ASP Program performs independent analyses for initiating events.  ASP analyses of \\ninitiating events account for all failures/d\\negraded conditions and unavailabilities (e.g., equipment \\nout for maintenance) that occurred during the event, regardless of licensee performance.\\n1  Additional LERs were reviewed to determine if concurrent unavailabilities existed during the \\nAugust\\n 10th eve\\nnt.  No windowed events were identified.\\n The plant and licensee response to this event was evaluated by NRC inspectors \\nas \\ndocumented \\nin \\ninspection report 05000331/2020003\\n, ﬁDuane Arnold Energy Center \\nŒ Integrated Inspection \\nReport\\n 05000331/2020003 \\nand 07200032/2020001\\n,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML20314A150\\n).  \\nInspectors evaluated th\\ne licensee's immediate and follow\\n-up corrective\\n actions to this event. \\n The inspectors \\nalso \\ndetermined that all equipment\\n responded as expected with \\na few \\nexceptions\\n (e.g., \\nloss of spent fuel\\n pool cooling\\n), and operators followed appropriate\\n response \\nproce\\ndures. \\n The inspectors determined that the licensee's corrective actions to\\n address this \\ncomplex event were appropriate to the circumstances and commensurate with\\n the potential \\nsafety significance.\\n  No findings or violations of more than minor significance\\n were identified.\\n  1  ASP analyses also account for any degraded condition(s) that were identified after the initiating event occurred if\\n the failure/degradation exposure \\ntime\\n(s) overlapped the initiating event date.\\n LER 331\\n-2020-001   5 3.2\\n Analysis Type\\n An initiating event analysis \\nwas performed using \\nRevision\\n 8.56\\n of the \\nSPAR model for \\nDuane \\nArnold Energy Center\\n created \\nin June\\n 2019.  This event was modeled as a \\nweather\\n-related\\n LOOP initiating event.\\n 3.3\\n SPAR Model \\nModifications\\n The following modifications were required for this initiating event analysis:\\n  Crediting FLEX Strategies\\n.  The probability of basic event FLX\\n-XHE\\n-XE-ELAP \\n(operators fail to declare ELAP when beneficial\\n) was set to its nominal value of 10\\n-2 to \\nactivate the credit for FLEX mitigation strategies for postulated SBO scenarios for which \\nan extended loss of AC power (ELAP) is declared.\\n2  FLEX Reliability Parameters\\n.  FLEX \\nhardware reliability \\nparameters suitable for inclusion \\nin the NRC SPAR models \\nis \\nnot yet\\n available.  Therefore, \\nthe \\nbase \\nSPAR model\\ns currently \\nuse the reliability\\n parameters\\n of permanently installed equipment\\n, which is\\n inconsistent with the limited experience with \\nthe operation of \\nFLEX\\n equipment\\n.  As part \\nof \\nan NRC audit \\nperformed \\nof p\\nreliminary FLEX \\nhardware data provided by the \\nPressurized Water Reactor Owner™s Group (PWROG)\\n, Idaho National Laboratory\\n reviewed the FLEX hardware parameter\\ns estimated by the PWROG\\n.  This review \\nrevealed that \\nFLEX diesel generator failure\\n-to-start\\n (FTS)\\n probability \\nis 3 to 10\\n times \\nhigher\\n and failure\\n-to-run\\n (FTR)\\n rate is \\n2 to 5\\n times \\nhigher than permanently installed \\nEDGs\\n.  The portable \\nengine\\n-driven\\n centrifugal pump FTS\\n probability\\n is \\nat least \\n8 times \\nhigher\\n and FTR rate \\nis \\nat least \\n6 times \\nhigher than permanently installed pumps\\n.  See \\nTable\\n 1 in \\nINL/EXT\\n-20-58327\\n, ﬁEvaluation of Weakly Informed Priors for FLEX Data\\n,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML20155K834)\\n for addition\\nal information.\\n  Therefore, t\\no provide \\na more representative\\n estimate of the FLEX \\nhardware r\\neliability\\n parameters, this \\nanalysi\\ns increased the hardware reliability \\nby a \\nfactor of \\nthree \\nin the best estimate case\\n.  The use of th\\ne FLEX hardware \\nmultiplier\\n is a key \\nmodeling\\n uncertainty\\n and is evaluated \\nfurther \\nin Section 4.3\\n.  Removal of EDG Repair Credit for ELAP Scenarios\\n.  The base SPAR model provides \\ncredit for repair of postulated EDG \\nfailures for SBO scen\\narios.  However, this potential \\ncredit is not applicable for scenarios where ELAP will be declared because (a.) operators \\n\\nwill be focused on implementing the FLEX mitigation strategies and (b.) the DC load \\nshedding activities could preclude recovery of EDG\\ns.  Therefore, credit for EDG repair \\ncredit was removed from the sequences if it is included after ELAP is likely declared \\n\\n(i.e.,\\n 1 hour)\\n via a change set containing the applicable EDG repair basic events\\n.  HPCI Credit\\n During ELAP Scenarios.\\n  The \\nbase SPAR model does not credit FLEX for \\nscenarios where RCIC is failed, but HPCI \\nis available\\n.  This assumption is likely \\nconservative and, therefore, \\nFLEX \\ncredit was\\n applied \\nby \\nmodifying the SBO event tree \\nby transferring the\\n SBO Sequence\\n 6 to the SBO ELAP event tree (see Figure\\n A-2 in \\nAppendix\\n A).  Most of the\\n FLEX information\\n available\\n, including \\nthermal\\n-hydraulic \\ncalcu\\nlations\\n, is focused on RCIC\\n performance and do\\nes not consider HPCI as an \\n 2  After the \\nDerecho storm had passed\\n the site, the licensee had the capability to pre\\n-stage FLEX equipment.  \\nHowever, after \\ndiscussing this possibility, the decision was made to\\n not move any \\nFLEX equipment.\\n LER 331\\n-2020-001   6 alternative high\\n-pressure injection source.\\n  Therefore, this \\nchange\\n is potentially \\nnonconservative.\\n  SBO-ELAP Event Tree Modification\\n.  The SBO\\n-ELAP event tree was modified to include \\nthe query of containment venting in scenarios when reactor depressurization fails.  \\nThe \\nmodified SBO\\n-ELAP event tree is provided in\\n Figure B\\n-1 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  Additional Mitigat\\nion Credit for Stuck\\n-Open SRV Scenarios\\n.  MELCOR calculations were \\nperformed to determine timing information \\nfor postulated stuck\\n-open SRV scenarios.  \\nSpecifically, the\\n time until RCIC/HPCI\\n isolation on low steam pressure (75 psig) and \\ntimes to core uncovery/damage\\n were calculated\\n.  Based on these calculations, the \\nRCIC \\nor HPCI would isolate on low steam pressure \\nin approximately 90\\n minutes given a single \\nstuck\\n-open SRV.  Core damage \\nis estim\\nated to occur \\nbetween\\n 4Œ6 hours.\\n  For \\ntwo \\nstuck\\n-open SRVs, \\nRCIC\\n/HPCI\\n would isolate in less than 1\\n hour and core d\\namage would \\noccur \\nin \\napproximately \\n90 minutes.  \\nDiscussions with the licensee revealed\\n that \\noperators\\n would have \\nenough\\n time to connect and initiate either firewater or FLEX \\nreactor \\npressure vessel (RPV) \\nmakeup\\n, which is not credited in the base SPAR model.  \\nTo provide this \\ncredit\\n, the \\napplicable sequences \\nwere transferred to the SBO\\n-ELAP \\nevent tree.\\n  In addition, offsite power recovery times for the SBO\\n-1 and SBO\\n-2 event \\ntrees were changed to \\n3 hours and 1\\n hour, respectively\\n, based on MELCOR calculation \\nestimates.\\n3  These modified event trees are provide\\nd in Figure\\ns B-2 and B\\n-3 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  72-Hour AC Power Recovery Requirement\\n.  The base SPAR model requires AC power \\nrecovery within 72\\n hours \\nfor a safe/stable end state for ELAP scenarios with successful \\nFLEX implementation.  If AC power is not recovered \\nin these scenarios, the SPAR \\nmodels assume core damage.  The American Society of Mechanical \\nEngineers/American Nuclear Society (ASME/ANS) probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) \\nstandard definition for safe/stable end state does not require AC power recovery. \\n Because of the large uncertainty in modeling assumptions related to availability and \\nreliability of components and strategies for mission times that are well beyond 24\\n hours \\nand the unclear basis for requiring AC power recovery within 72\\n hours, the 72\\n-hour AC \\npower requirement was eliminated in this analysis by inserting a new basic event, OPR\\n-72HR\\n-OFF (\\nno 72-hr OPR requirement\\n), under the top event in the OPR\\n-72H fault tree \\nand setting it to FALSE.  This change is considered a key modeling uncertainty for\\n this \\nanalysis.  This modified fault tree is provided in Figure\\n B-4 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  As part of this \\nchange, the FTR events for FLEX diesel generators and pumps have a 72\\n-hour mission \\ntime in the base SPAR model.  These mission \\ntimes were reset to be consistent with the \\n24-hour mission time used in the SPAR model.\\n  Credit for \\nTechnical Support Center (TSC) Diesel Generator\\n.  The SBO\\n-ELAP event tree \\ncurrent\\nly credits \\nthe \\nFLEX \\n480-volt (V) diesel generators\\n in the FLEX\\n-480 fault tree.  \\nHowever, \\nthe plant has \\nan additional \\nTSC diesel generator that can al\\nso charge the \\nsafety\\n-related batteries\\n.  Therefore, the FLEX\\n-480 fault tree was modified by inserting \\nthe existing\\n DG-TSC\\n fault tree and changing the existing gate structure\\n to ensure both \\nthe FLEX and TSC diesel generators a\\nre \\npotentially \\navailable to provide \\nbattery \\ncharging\\n.  The two human failure events (HFEs)\\n FLX\\n-XHE\\n-XM-480 (\\noperators fail to \\n 3  The associated \\nEDG repair times were also changed.  \\nHowever, this change does not affect this analysis\\n because EDG repair is not credited after ELAP is declared.\\n LER 331\\n-2020-001   7 stage or run or load or refuel 480V portable flex diesel\\n) and\\n EPS-XHE\\n-XM-TSC \\n(operator action to align TSC DG to battery chargers\\n) are treated as completely \\ndependent in the SPAR model post\\n-processing rules\\n.  This modified fault tree is \\nprovided in Figure\\n B-5 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  Credit for Firewater\\n Pump\\n.  The SBO\\n-ELAP event tree current\\nly credits FLEX RPV \\nmakeup\\n in the FLEX\\n-RPV fault tree.  However, \\nfirewater is not currently credited.\\n  Therefore, the \\nFLEX\\n-RPV fault tree \\nwas modified by inserting \\nthe \\nexisting \\nFWS fault tree\\n and changing the existing gate structure \\nto ensure both\\n firewater and the FLEX RPV \\nmakeup pumps are available to provide reactor inventory makeup.  \\nIn the FWS \\nfault \\ntree, t\\nhe human error probability (HEP) for existing \\nHFE FWS\\n-XHE\\n-XM-ERRLT \\n(operator fails \\nto align firewater injection\\n) was set to a screening value\\n 0.1\\n.4  In addition, \\nFWS\\n-XHE\\n-XM-ERRLT\\n and existing basic event FWS\\n-EDP\\n-TM1P49 (\\ndiesel fire pump is \\nunavailable because of maintenance\\n) were \\nmoved under a new ‚AND™ gate because the \\nfirewater pump \\nwas undergoing maintenance \\nat the onset of the event; however, \\noperators could clear the maintenance tags to restore the pump within 1 hour, if needed\\n.  The two HFEs \\nFWS\\n-XHE\\n-XM-ERRLT and \\nFLX-XHE\\n-XM-RPV\\n (operators fail to stage or \\nrun or supply or refill FLEX RPV pump\\n) are treated as completely dependent in the \\nSPAR model post\\n-processing rules.  \\nThis modified fault tree\\ns are\\n provided in \\nFigure\\ns B-6 and B-7 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  Use of Environmental Common\\n-Cause\\n Failure (CCF)\\n Parameters for ESW Strainers\\n.  To \\nimprove \\nthe realism in the \\nmodel\\ning of\\n potential \\nCCF\\n of the \\nESW \\nstrainers due to the \\nincreased debris loading experienced during the event,\\n the alpha factors for ESW \\nstrainers were modified to those of environmental events (instead of all causes)\\n, which \\nare more representative \\nof the conditions experienced during the event\\n.  Specifically,\\n the \\nalpha factors ZA\\n-STR\\n-PG-SWS\\n-02A01 \\n(alpha factor 1 \\nin group size 2 for component \\nSTR with failure mode PG:SWS\\n) and ZA\\n-STR\\n-PG-SWS\\n-02A02 (\\nalpha factor 2 in group \\nsize 2 for component STR with failure mode PG:SWS\\n) were changed from their nominal \\nvalues to 0.874 and 0.126,\\n respectively\\n.5  Credit for Ability to \\nBypass Clogged ESW Strainers\\n.  The ability for operators to bypass \\nthe clogged ESW strainers\\n is not included in the base SPAR model.  To provide this \\ncredit\\n, new fault trees ESW\\n-STRAINER\\n-A (ESW pump A discharge strainer plugs\\n) and \\nESW STRAINER\\n-B (ESW pump \\nA discharge strainer plugs\\n) were created\\n.  These two \\nnew fault trees include the existing strainer independent failure and CCF basic events \\nalong with new \\nHFE\\n ESW\\n-XHE\\n-XM-BYPASS (\\noperators fail to bypass plugged strainer\\n), \\nwhich credits the ability of operators to bypass a clogged ESW strainer.  \\nThese new fault \\ntrees are provided in Figures\\n B-6 and B\\n-7 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  ESW-XHE\\n-XM-BYPASS was \\nevaluated using \\nNUREG/CR\\n-6883, ﬁThe SPAR H Human Reliability Analysis Method,ﬂ \\n(ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML051950061).  The HEP for ESW\\n-XHE\\n-XM-BYPASS was \\ncalculated to be 1×10\\n-3; see Appendix\\n C for additional information\\n.  Fault tree ESW\\n-STRAINER\\n-A was inserted as a transfer tree in fault trees ESW\\n-A and ESW\\n-DGN\\n-A to \\nsubstitute for the existing strainer independent failure and CCF basic events.  Likewise, \\n 4  NUREG\\n-1792, ﬁGood Practices for Implementing Human Reliability \\nAnalysis,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession \\nNo.\\n ML051160213) provides that 0.1 is an appropriate screening (i.e., typically conservative) value for most post\\n-initiator HFEs.\\n 5  These alpha factor changes also affect the residual heat removal (RHR) service water heat syste\\nm strainers.  \\nThe RHR service water system takes its suction of the same pit as ESW.\\n LER 331\\n-2020-001   8 fault tree ESW\\n-STRAINER\\n-B was inserted in fault trees ESW\\n-B and ESW\\n-DGN\\n-B.  \\nThese modified \\nfault\\n trees are provided in Figures\\n B-8 through B\\n-13 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  Reactor Water Level Control During \\na LOOP\\n.  The existing \\nHFEs for reactor water level \\ncontrol using RCIC (\\nRCI-XHE\\n-XO-ERROR, \\nRCI-XHE\\n-XM-OPERATE\\n, RCI\\n-XHE\\n-XM-OPERATE2\\n) and/or HPCI (\\nHCI-XHE\\n-XO-ERROR, \\nHCI-XHE\\n-XO-ERROR1\\n) were not \\nevaluated \\nto \\naccount for the \\nprocedures directing operators to bypass the \\nhigh\\n reactor \\nwater level (Level 8) pump \\ntrips\\n, raise reactor wat\\ner level\\n, and control level in a\\n relatively \\nnarrow (\\n10-inch\\n) band when \\nforced circulation is lost\\n.  With the pump trips bypas\\nsed, a \\nfailure to control level could result in flooding the pump turbines \\nresulting in a loss of \\nboth high\\n-pressure injection systems\\n.  To better represent this action, a new ba\\nsic event \\nRCS-XHE\\n-XM-LEVEL (\\noperators fail to control reactor water level duri\\nng loss of forced \\ncirculation\\n) was inserted in the applicable fault trees\\n (HCI, HCI01, HCI02, RCI, RCI01, \\nRCI02, FLX\\n-TDP, FLX\\n-TDP\\n2) to replace the existing HFEs\\n for \\nLOOP scenarios\\n.  The HFE RCS\\n-XHE\\n-XM-LEVEL was evaluated using IDHEAS\\n-ECA methodology because \\nthe performance shaping factors \\n(PSF\\ns) of \\nthe \\nSPAR\\n-H method \\ndo not represent control \\nactions very well.\\n  The HEP for \\nRCS-XHE\\n-XM-LEVEL\\n was calculated to be \\n2×10\\n-2; see \\nAppendix\\n C for additional informati\\non.  SPAR Model Quantification Issues\\n.  A review of preliminary analysis results identified \\nsome \\nSPAR model quantifications issues that required \\nchanges.  First, t\\nhe component \\nID was deleted from basic event FWS\\n-EDP\\n-TM-1P49 (\\ndiesel fire pump is \\nunavailable \\nbecause of maintenance\\n) because it was causing calculation errors.\\n  Second, \\nsome \\nevent tree linkage rules were added to the SBO event tree. \\n These rules substituted in \\ninitiator specific \\npower recovery logic to facilitate more accurate calculat\\nion of success \\npath cut sets.\\n 3.4\\n Analysis\\n Assumptions\\n The following modeling assumptions were \\nrequired to reflect the plant status and event \\ncircumstances \\nfor\\n this initiating event assessment\\n:  The probability of IE\\n-LOOP\\nWR (loss of offsite power (\\nweather\\n-related\\n)) was set to 1.0 \\ndue to the loss of offsite power. \\n All other initiating event probabilities were set to zero.\\n  Basic event ESW\\n-STR\\n-PG-PDISB (\\nESW pump B discharge strainer 1S\\n-89B plugs\\n) was \\nset to TRUE due to ESW train ‚B™ strainer becoming \\nclogged during the event.\\n  Basic event FWS\\n-EDP\\n-TM-1P49\\n was set to \\nTRUE\\n because th\\ne pump was undergoing \\nmaintenance during the event.  All other test and maintenance probabilities were kept at \\ntheir nominal values.\\n  Offsite power was recovered to \\nthe \\nsafety buses approximately 25 hours after the LOOP \\noccurred\\n.  Based\\n on the event information and \\ndiscussions with \\nRegion\\n 3 inspectors, \\nit \\nwas determined that offsite\\n power could have been restored \\nto the safety buses \\nshortly \\nafter the\\n Vinton offsite power line was restor\\ned approximately 23 hours \\nafter\\n the LOOP \\noccurred\\n.  Therefore, basic events OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR30M\\nWR (operators fail to recover \\noffsite power in 30 minutes\\n), OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR01HWR (\\noperators fail to recover offsite \\npower in 1 hour\\n), OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR05HWR (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in 5 \\nhours\\n), OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR08HWR (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in 8 hours\\n), \\nOEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR10HWR (\\noperators fail to\\n recover offsite power in 10 hours\\n), \\nand \\nOEP\\n-LER 331\\n-2020-001   9 XHE\\n-XL-NR012HWR (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in 12 hours\\n) were set \\nTRUE.\\n  The HEP for b\\nasic event \\nOEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR024HWR (\\noperators fail to recover \\noffsite power in 24 hours\\n) was \\ncalculated\\n to be 2×10\\n-3; see \\nAppendix\\n C for additional \\ninformation\\n.  Both\\n control rod drive (CRD) pumps were impacted by using the \\nMSL\\n drains to the \\ncondenser for cooldown.  The operating CRD pump developed a seal leak\\n and was \\nsecured\\n.  In addition, operators manually started the standby pump\\n when \\nit became \\nvapor bound \\ndue to \\nthe \\nhigh \\nsuction \\nwater \\ntemperature.\\n  Therefore, basic events \\nCRD-MDP\\n-FR-A (CRD pump A fails to run\\n) and CRD\\n-MDP\\n-FS-B (CRD pump B fails to start\\n) were set to TRUE.\\n  This modeling assumption is potentially conservative; however, the \\nnonrecoverable failure of the CRD system results in negligible risk contribution for th\\nis \\nanalysis.\\n 4 ANALYSIS RESULTS \\n  4.1\\n Preliminary \\nResults\\n The mean\\n CCDP for this analysis is \\npreliminarily \\ncalculated to be \\n8×10\\n-4.  The ASP Program \\nthreshold for initiating events is a CCDP of 10\\n-6 or the \\nplant\\n-specific \\nCCDP of an uncomplicated \\nreactor trip \\nwith a non\\n-recoverable loss of feed water or the condenser heat sink, whichever is \\ngreater.

The results of any sensitivity \\nanalyses \\nperformed to \\nevaluate these uncertainties are provided in \\nTable\\n 4.  The Amount of Credit for \\nFLEX \\nMitigation Strategies\\n.  The credit\\ning of FLEX mitigation \\nstrategies has as significant impact on these analysis results\\n.  A sensitivity analysis \\nyields \\nan increase in \\nCCDP\\n of \\napproximately a factor of 10\\n with\\nout\\n FLEX credit.\\n  While \\ncredit is appropriate, it is important to note that th\\nere \\nare considerable un\\ncertainties\\n (as \\ndiscussed below)\\n associated with \\nvarious aspects of \\nFLEX modeling.\\n  HPCI Credit During ELAP Scenarios.\\n  The base SPAR model does not credit FLEX for \\nscenarios where RCIC is failed, but HPCI \\nis available.  This assumption is likely \\nconservative and, therefore, FLEX credit was applied by modifying the SBO event tree\\n.  Most of the FLEX information available, \\nincluding thermal\\n-hydraulic calcu\\nlations, is \\nfocused on RCIC performance and does not consider HPCI as an alternative high\\n-pressure injection source.  \\nBecause \\nthe use of\\n FLEX \\nin scenarios that only HPCI is \\navailable has not been analyzed, \\ncrediting \\nFLEX in\\n such \\nscenarios may\\n be unrealistic \\nand may \\noverestimate\\n the \\nrisk re\\nduction \\nachieved by crediting FLEX\\n.  A sensitivity \\nanalysi\\ns yields a\\nn increase in \\nCCDP of \\napproximately \\n120 percent \\nwithout FLEX credit\\n for scenarios where HPCI is successful and RCIC is un\\navailable/failed\\n.  FLEX Hardware Reliability\\n.  As previously mentioned, \\nhardware reliabilit\\nies\\n for FLEX \\nequipment \\nare\\n not \\ncurrently available and, therefore, the SPAR model uses the reliability \\nof permanently installed equipment\\n, which is \\nconsidered nonconservative\\n.  Based on \\npreliminary data received from the PWROG, failure probabilities and rates for FLEX \\ndiesel generators and engine\\n-driven centrifugal pump\\ns are \\n2 to \\n10 times \\nmore \\nlikely to \\nfail \\nthan \\npermanently installed \\nequipment\\n.  Ther\\nefore, \\nsensitivity analyses were \\nperformed using the multiplier range \\nof 2 to 10 times that of permanently installed \\nequipment\\n.  These sensitivity \\nanalyses yield a decrease in CCDP of \\n3 percent for a \\nmultiplier of 2 and an increase in CCDP of approximately\\n 18 percent \\nand\\n 57 percent\\n for \\nmultipliers of 5 and 10\\n, respectively\\n. LER 331\\n-2020-001   11  FLEX Human Reliability\\n.  D\\netailed human reliability analysis was not performed for FLEX \\nmitigation strategies\\n for the SPAR models\\n.  Placeholder values for the HEPs that were \\njudged to \\nbe reasonable by model developers are currently used.\\n  A re\\nview of these \\nHEPs did not identify any \\nsignificant \\nissues\\n and are judged to be reasonable for this \\nanalysis\\n.  Future HRA \\nof these actions will likely result in\\n HEP\\n increases for some \\nHFEs \\nand decr\\neases\\n for others\\n.  Sensitivity analys\\nis increasing and decreasing these HEPs by \\na factor of 5 results in an increase in CCDP of \\n135\\n percent and decrease in CCDP\\n of \\n27 percent, respectively\\n.  72-Hour AC Power Recovery Requirement\\n.  Th\\nis analysis eliminated t\\nhe 72\\n-hour AC \\npower recovery credit\\n for ELAP scenarios with successful implementation of the re\\nquired \\nFLEX mitigation strategies.  \\nRequiring AC power recovery within 72\\n hours as originally \\nincluded in the SPAR model \\nresults in an approximately \\n34 percent\\n increase in CCDP \\nwithout a clear technical basis.\\n7  Potential \\nEffect\\ns of \\nBypassing ESW \\nStrainer\\n.  During the event, operators successfully \\nbypassed ESW train ‚B™ strainer\\n and EDG ‚B™ \\nsuccessfully \\nran throughout the event \\n(greater than 24\\n hours)\\n.

An \\nauxiliary operator (AO) was sent in accordance with the \\n\\nalarm response procedure. When the operator arrived, the \\nESW train ‚B™ strainer differential pressure reached 15\\n psid \\nand was directed by the main control room operators to \\nbypass the strainer. This was completed within 15\\n minutes. \\nTherefore, the nominal t\\nime for this HFE is assumed to be \\n5 minutes for diagnosis and 10\\n minutes for action.\\n  Although ESW train ‚B™ flow to its respective EDG had \\ndecreased dropped from 1100 to 800\\n gpm, operators did not \\nobserve any degradation in EDG ‚B™ performance. It is \\nbeli\\neved that strainer debris loading peaked at this level (as \\nindicated by the ESW train ‚A™ not increasing after reaching \\n11 psid even though its strainer was not bypassed). It is \\npossible that EDG ‚B™ would have continued to run \\nsatisfactorily with the plug\\nged strainer with a differential \\npressure of 15\\n psid. For this event assessment, it is assumed \\nthat operators would have approximately 1\\n hour to bypass \\nthe strainer, which is could be potential conservative.

We understand that the decision to credit HPCI averted undue \\nconservatism.  The decision to credit HPCI \\nwas researched and even informed by \\nthermal\\n-hydraulic analysis.  We believe this approach to increase realism of the PRA \\nanalysis is a strength.\\n  NRR, Section 3.3:\\n We noted that the analysis adjusted the portable FLEX equipment to a \\n24-hour mission time to \\nestimate \\nFTR probability. \\n While we understand a 72\\n-hour mission \\ntime would be overly conservative, would a 24\\n-hour mission time be potentially non\\n-conservative? \\n However, since the analysis has identified failure probabilities of FLEX \\nequipment as a key u\\nncertainty and performed appropriate sensitivity analysis, we do not \\nconsider this observation as a substantive comment.\\n  NRR, Section 4.1:\\n The use of a mean value rather than a point estimate is acceptable and \\nsupported by references such as NUREG\\n-1489, an\\nd NUREG\\n-1855.\\n D.2\\n Comments Requiring Response or Change\\n  Region 3, Executive Summary:\\n The \\nExecutive Summary\\n states the following\\n: ﬁAlthough \\nthe preliminary mean CCDP of 1\\n×10-3 for this event currently meets the criterion for a \\nsignificant precursor, the risk to the public remained very low because defense in depth and \\nplant\\n-wide safety margins were maintained.ﬂ  This sentence is simultaneously describing the \\nrisk as both high a\\nnd low.  In the interest of clarity and consistency of our message about \\nthe high safety significance of this issue, consider changing the wording.  One possible \\nalternative would be: ﬁthe risk of core damage was mitigated because defense in depth and \\nplan\\nt-wide safety margins were maintained.ﬂ\\n RES Response/Action:\\n The suggested change \\nwas\\n implemented in the final report\\n.

Recall that the \\n‚B™ train \\nESW \\nstrainer reached 15\\n psid and required bypassing due to debri\\ns loading. \\n The ‚A™ train strainer reached 11\\n psid and did not require bypassing but represented a potential \\nchallenge or a ﬁnear miss.ﬂ  This challenge to both trains of \\nESW \\nis one of the main drivers \\nof the high \\nCCDP \\nand the reason that the LIC\\n-504 effor\\nt was started.  Consider adding \\nthese insights in the \\nExecutive Summary\\n and the \\nEvent Description\\n that describes how both \\nservice water \\ntrains were simultaneously \\naffected\\n.  This would have the benefit of\\n  (a.)\\n increas\\ning\\n transparency for those reading the ASP analysis and \\n(b) provide a better \\ntechnical basis for adjustment of the \\ncommon\\n-cause failure alpha factors described in \\nSection\\n 3.3\\n. RES Response/Action:\\n A description of the challenge to the train ‚A™ ESW strainer \\nwas\\n added to the \\nExecutive Summary\\n and \\nSection 2.1\\n of the final report\\n.  Region 3, \\nExecutive Summary and Section 2.1\\n: Considered changing the following \\nsentence: ﬁThe licensee later determined that damage to the reactor building resulted in the \\nsecondary containment being inoperable according to TS due to i\\nnsufficient vacuum.ﬂ  \\nSuggested replacement: ﬁThe licensee later determined that, although damaged, secondary \\n\\ncontainment remained functional throughout the event and if challenged, would have \\nprevented a radiological release to the environment.  However, \\nwhen tested, the vacuum \\n\\ndrawn in secondary containment by the standby gas treatment system was slightly below \\nthe very conservative technical specification limit.ﬂ\\n RES Response/Action:\\n The suggested change \\nwas\\n implemented in the final report\\n.  Region 3, \\nSection 2.1\\n: The control rod drive (\\nCRD\\n) pumps were impacted by using the \\nmain steam line drains to the condenser for cooldown.  The operating CRD pump developed \\n\\na seal leak.  The standby pump was started, and th\\ne pump became vapor bound due to the \\nhigh temperature at the suction of the pump.  Consider whether the report should discuss \\nthis impact and model as appropriate given that CRD is a BWR alternate injection source for \\nlate injection.  While this condition \\nwould not impact the current dominant sequences, it \\ncould impact other LOOP core damage sequences.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n The degradation of both CRD pumps \\nwas\\n modeled explicitly in the \\nanalysis and documented in the final report (\\nSection\\n 3.4\\n).  Note that this change has a \\nnegligible effect on the result because four additional systems (ESW, residual heat removal \\n\\nservice water, firewater, and general service water) are credited for late injection during a \\nLOOP.\\n  Region \\n3, \\nSection 2.\\n2: Consider deleting the following sentence:\\n ﬁThe event was not \\nconsidered a beyond design basis eventﬂ.

As it is currently \\nwritten, the sentence is not factually correct.  After the Derecho storm had passed the sit\\ne, \\nthe licensee had the capability and flexibility to pre\\n-stage the FLEX equipment.

Our comment would be that this is appropriate to do on a case\\n-by-case \\nbasis, it would be useful to show a sensitivity showing how much of an effect this had on the \\nresults.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n A sensitivity case\\n crediting\\n EDG repair for ELAP scenario \\nestimates a mean CCDP \\n6×10-4 (a decrease of approximately \\n20 percent).  \\nThe issue of \\ncrediting EDG repair in the base SPAR models could be reconsidered.  \\nIt is\\n a typical SPAR \\nmodel practice to not credit strategies n\\not included in the licensee PRAs\\n, yet less than a \\nthird \\nof licensee PRAs include credit for EDG repair\\n.  In addition\\n, the nonrecovery \\nprobabilities are calculated by INL using data extracted from unplanned unavailability times \\nfrom MSPI (typically normal operations with only a single EDG to troubleshoot).  During the \\nLER 331\\n-2020-001   D-4 Level 3 PRA project, industry peer review members questi\\noned the basis for crediting repair \\nof the EDGs, which had been adopted from the SPAR models.  Subsequently, it was \\ndecided to remove EDG repair from the Level 3 PRA because the staff questioned whether \\nrepair data collected under normal conditions is appl\\nicable to SBO scenarios where \\nconditions may be different (e.g., reduce\\nd lighting, increased stress, staffing constraints) and \\nthere would be multiple EDG failures to troubleshoot.  Although there could also be factors \\n(e.g., increased priority, eliminatio\\nn of restrictive licensee processes) that reduce the repair \\ntime.\\n  NextEra, Section 3.4:\\n The preliminary \\nASP analysis \\nused the timeline that was developed \\nfor the \\nLER\\n to note that power was not restored to the safety buses from an offsite power \\nsource until\\n twenty\\n-five hours after the LOOP occurred1. \\n However, the Vinton 161\\n-kV line \\nwas restored as a power source at 11:26. \\n As the plant was in a safe and stable \\nconfiguration the ensuing period was taken up with coordinating a deliberate and \\nuninterrupted tra\\nnsfer of power from the \\nEDGs\\n to the offsite power supply. \\n Had an \\nEDG\\n failed at any point after 11:26, offsite power was available to re\\n-energize emergency busses. \\nTherefore, offsite power was available to be restored to the safety buses approximately \\n22.6\\n hours after the event started and not 25 hours.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n Based on this comment and subsequent discussion with Region\\n 3 inspectors, we agree that credit for offsite power recovery at 24\\n hours should be provided.  \\nThe applicable text in the Anal\\nysis Assumptions (\\nSection\\n 3.4\\n) has been revised.  This \\nchange results in the mean CCDP decreasing from 1\\n×10-3 to 8\\n×10-4. D.3\\n Comments Concerning Base SPAR Model Considerations\\n  NextEra:\\n The SPAR model\\ns utilize generic data out of the NRC Reactor Operating \\nExperience Database. \\n The PWR\\nOG recently reviewed the component reliability data and \\nidentified that the \\nFTR data used in the SPAR models is potentially over\\n-estimating the \\nprobability of diesel failur\\nes. \\n The PWROG\\n, when reviewing this data, showed that the rate \\nfor diesel generators \\nFTR\\n could be reduced from 1.\\n4×10\\n-3 per hour to 8.4\\n×10\\n-4 per hour.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n This data issue, along with others previously reported \\nin PWROG\\n-18026-P, ﬁComponent \\nReliability Data Issues and Strategies\\n,ﬂ \\nis currently being reviewed by \\nthe NRC and INL.  \\nIn the interim, INL performed a revised calculation \\nfor the EDG FTR rate \\nusing data from \\nthe \\n2010Œ2019 period and \\nconsistent with\\n existing Institute of Nuclear \\nPower Operations (INPO) guidance. \\n This calculation resulted in \\nmean failure rate of \\n1.32\\n×10-3 per hour (\\n103 failures in 82,768 hours)\\n.  Note that the number of run hours from \\nfailures to load/run (FTLR) failure mode (i.e., f\\nailures to run within 1 hour) is not deducted \\nfrom the run hours in the FTR failure mode in the above calculation.\\n  This revised\\n failure rate \\nis only 1\\n3 percent\\n lower than the current EDG FTR rate of 1.52\\n×10-3 per hour.\\n  Since this \\nrevised\\n rate\\n is within a reasonable uncertainty range \\nof the FTR rate used in the analysis \\nand is not expected to make a significant impact on the overall CCDP\\n, the ED\\nG FTR rate \\nwas not changed in the best estimate case.\\n  NextEra:\\n The preliminary \\nASP analysis \\nassume\\ns that\\n core damage would occur without \\naccounting for the specific failure modes that were present in the cut\\n sets. \\n The most \\nsignificant conservatism was that \\nFTR events\\n (e.g., EDG or RCIC)\\n, were assumed to occur \\nat the start of the event\\n (i.e., t \\n= 0).  Howeve\\nr, this failure mode does not align with the \\ngeneric SPAR data as a\\nn FTR \\nevent is noted as occurring after the first hour and up to \\nLER 331\\n-2020-001   D-5 24 hours. \\n Incorporating this time dependence would allow for additional credit for FLEX \\nmitigation strategies.\\n RES Response\\n/Action:\\n The treatment of FTR events in the SPAR models is consistent \\nwith the current state\\n-of-practice.  \\nThe assumption that failures occur at the start of the event \\nis in part addressed by applying factors related to convolution of EDG FTR \\nevents.\\n  However, this convolution credit does not \\nmeaningfully \\naffect the analysis for this event \\nlargely due to \\nthe \\nlong time (~23 hours) until offsite power could be recovered.  It is \\nrecognized that this treatment is conservative, but the proper treatm\\nent of FTR failure would \\nlikely require aspects of ﬁdynamicﬂ PRA, which is beyond the scope of this analysis.\\n  NRR, Section 3.3:\\n We agree with the basis to eliminate the 72\\n-hour AC power recovery \\nrequirement since that assumption introduces an unnecessary conservatism.  This raises an \\nissue in the opinion of at least this analyst that we should follow\\n-up on.  Should we consider \\neli\\nminating this conservatism from SPAR models to enhance their accuracy after further \\ndiscussions among cognizant stakeholders (NRR\\n\\DRA, RES\\n\\DRA, SRAs, and INL staff)?\\n RES Response/Action:\\n This issue will be discussed with internal stakeholders to determine \\nif there is a consensus opinion\\n to eliminate the 72\\n-hour AC power recovery requirement\\n in \\nall SPAR models\\n.

resulted in a reactor scram.  Emergency diesel generators (EDGs) \\n1 and 2 automatically \\nstarted and loaded to their respective emergency buses. \\n Operators manually \\nstarted reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) and high\\n-pressure coolant injection (HPCI\\n) to \\n\\nmaintain \\nreactor water level\\n and provide pressure control, respectively\\n.  An Unusual Event \\nwas \\ndeclared \\nat 11:12 p.m.\\n  At the time of the event, Unit 1 was in the process of shutting down for \\nmaintenance associated with a ground on the main \\ngenerator\\n and was not synced to the grid.\\n As a result of the reactor trip, reactor water level reached low level 1\\n, which results in an \\nisolation signal of the \\nGroup 2 (i.e., floor and equipment drain\\ns), Group 6 (i.e., monitoring and \\nsampl\\ning\\n) and Group 8 \\n(i.e., shutdown cooling\\n) valves\\n.  The Group 8 valves were closed at the \\ntime of the event. \\n Per design, the \\nLOOP \\nalso caused a Group 1 (i.e., main steam isolation \\nvalve) isolation.\\n  The Unit 1 LOOP did not affect Unit 2, which remained at 100\\n-percent power\\n.  Operators restored offsite power to the Unit 1 nonsafety\\n-related buses from the UAT in \\napproximately 37\\n minutes.\\n  Offsite power was restored \\nto the two safety buses via the station \\nauxiliary transformer (SAT) \\nand the Unusual \\nEvent\\n was exited at 2:54 p\\n.m. on August 4\\nth. This accident sequence precursor (ASP) analysis reveals that the most likely core damage \\n\\nsequence \\nis a loss of offsite power (LOOP) initiating event and the successful operation of the \\nEDGs providing safety\\n-related alternating current (AC) power with subsequent (postulated) \\nfailure of both HPCI and RCIC and operators failing to depressurize the reactor\\n.  This accident \\nsequence accounts for approximately 7\\n2 percent of the total conditional core damage probability \\n(CCDP) for this event.\\n  FLEX mitigation strategies were credited in this analysis; however, the \\nrisk impact was minimal because postulated stat\\nion blackout (SBO) scenarios are not a \\ndominant risk contributor.\\n  The ASP analysis\\n results\\n reinforce\\n that a LOOP \\nresulting from\\n natural phenomenon outside the licensees™ control is a s\\nubstantial \\nrisk contributor\\n; however,\\n plant and operator response were\\n timely and appropriate to mitigate the risk of the event.\\n LER \\n325-2020-003  2 2 EVENT \\nDETAILS \\n  2.1 Event Description\\n On August 3, 2020\\n, a LOOP \\noccurred on \\nBrunswick Steam Electric Plant Uni\\nt 1 that resulted in \\na reactor scram.  EDGs \\n1 and 2 automatically \\nstarted and loaded to the\\nir respective emergency \\nbuses. \\n Operators manually started RCIC and HPCI to maintain \\nreactor water level\\n and provide \\npressure control, respectively\\n.  An Unusual Event \\nwas declared \\nat 11:12 p.m.\\n  At the time of the \\nevent, Unit 1 was in the process of \\nshutting down for maintenance associated with a ground on \\nthe main generator\\n and was not synced to the grid.\\n As a result of the reactor trip, reactor water level reached low level 1\\n, which results in an \\nisolation signal of the \\nGroup 2 (i.e., floor and equi\\npment drain\\ns), Group 6 (i.e., monitoring and \\nsampl\\ning\\n) and Group 8 (i.e., shutdown cooling\\n) valves\\n.  The Group 8 valves were closed at the \\ntime of the event. \\n Per design, the \\nLOOP \\nalso caused a Group 1 (i.e., main steam isolation \\nvalve) isolation.\\n  The Uni\\nt 1 LOOP did not affect Unit 2, which remained at 100\\n-percent power.\\n1  Operators restored offsite power to the \\nUnit 1 \\nnonsafety\\n-related buses from the\\n UAT in \\napproximately 37\\n minutes.\\n  Offsite power was restored \\nto the two safety buses via the SAT \\nand the Unusual Event was exited at 2:54 pm. on August 4\\nth.  Additional information is provided in \\nlicensee event report (L\\nER) 325-2020-002, ﬁAutomatic Specified System Actuations due to Loss \\nof Offsite Power\\n,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML20265A162\\n). 2.2 Cause\\n The licensee determined that the \\nelectrical fault that \\nresulted \\nin \\nthe transformer bus powering \\nthe SAT to trip and\\n the subsequent LOOP was \\ncaused \\nstorm\\n-generated debris from\\n Hurricane \\nIsaias\\n. 3 MODELING \\n  3.1 SDP Results/Basis for ASP Analysis\\n The ASP Program performs independent analyses for initiating events. \\n ASP analyses of\\n initiating events account for all failures/degraded conditions and unavailabilities (e.g., equipment\\n \\nout for maintenance) th\\nat occurred during the event, regardless of licensee performance.\\n2 Additional LERs were reviewed to determine if concurrent unavailabilities existed during the\\n August 3\\nrd event. \\n No windowed events were identified.\\n  Discussions with Region 2 staff indicate\\n that no licensee performance deficienc\\ny associated with this event ha\\ns been identified; \\nhowever, the LER remains open.\\n 3.2 Analysis Type\\n An initiating event analysis \\nwas performed using \\nRevision\\n 9.33 of the standardized plant \\nanalysis risk (SPAR) model for \\nBrunswick Steam Electric Plant\\n (Unit\\n 1) created on \\nJuly\\n 31, 2020.  This event was modeled as a switchyard\\n-centered LOOP initiating event.\\n  1  The Unit 2 EDGs started but did not load onto their respective safety buses because they remained energized \\nvia offsite power throughout the event.\\n 2  ASP analyses also account for any degraded condition(s) that were identified after the initiating event occurred if\\n the failure/degradation exposure \\ntime\\n(s) overlapped the initiating event date.\\n LER \\n325-2020-003  3 3.3 SPAR Model Modifications\\n No SPAR model modifications were needed for\\n this analysis.\\n 3.4 Analysis\\n Assumptions\\n The following modeling assumptions were determined to be significant to the modeling of this \\ninitiating \\nevent assessment:\\n  The probability of IE\\n-LOOPSC (\\nloss of offsite power (switchyard\\n-centered)\\n) was set to \\n1.0 due to the loss of offsite power. \\n All other initiating event probabilities were set to \\nzero.\\n  Basic event OEP\\n-VCF\\n-LP-SITESC (\\nsite LOOP (switchyard\\n-centered)\\n) was set to FALSE \\nbecause the event was single unit LOOP.\\n  The probability of basic event FLX\\n-XHE\\n-XM-ELAP (\\noperators fail to declare \\nELAP\\n when \\nbeneficial\\n) was set to \\nit nominal \\nvalue of 1\\n×10-2 to activate the credit for FLEX mitigation \\nstrategies for SBO scenarios for which an extended loss of AC power (ELAP) is \\ndeclared.  Sensitivity analyses show that \\nthe amount of FLEX credit \\nhas a \\nminimal\\n impact on the\\n analysis\\n results.\\n  Offsite power was restored \\nto the two safety buses via the SAT in approximately 15 and \\n17 hours, respectively\\n.  It is believed that operators could have restored offsite power \\nmore quic\\nkly if postulated\\n SBO had occurred.  However, \\nan exact determination on \\nwhen \\nthe offsite\\n power\\n could have been restored is not available\\n.  Given this uncertainty, \\nbasic event\\ns OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR30MSC (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in \\n30 minutes\\n) and OEP-XHE\\n-XL-NR0\\n2HSC (operators fail to recover offsite power in \\n2 hours) were\\n set to TRUE. \\n Although this assumption is potential\\nly conservative, \\nsensitivity analyses show \\ncredit for \\nthe \\noffsite power recovery \\nhas a \\nminimal impact\\n on the analysis results.\\n 4 ANALYSIS RESULTS \\n  4.1 Results\\n The mean\\n CCDP \\nfor this analysis is calculated to be \\n2.0×10-5.  The ASP Program threshold \\nfor \\ninitiating events \\nis a CCDP of \\n10-6 or the \\nplant\\n-specific \\nCCDP of an uncomplicated reactor trip \\nwith a non\\n-recoverable loss of feed water or the condenser heat sink, whichever is greater. \\n This \\nCCDP equivalent for \\nBrunswick Steam Electric \\nPlant (Unit \\n1) is \\n1.5×10-5.

FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (FitzPatrick).  As \\ndescribed in the subject inspection report, the NRC determined that this finding involved \\napparent violations of Title 10 of the \\nCode of Federal Regulations\\n (10 CFR) Part 50, \\nAppendix B, Criterion XV, ﬁNonconforming Materials, Parts, or Componentsﬂ and Criterion VII, \\nﬁControl of Purchased Material, Equipment, and Services.ﬂ  The receipt and use of the defective \\npart at FitzPatrick resulted in a failure of the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) system on \\nApril 10, 2020.\\nConsequently, ExGenalso violated FitzPatrick Technical Specification \\n(TS) 3.5.1, since the HPCI system was determined to be inoperable for greater than the TS \\nallowed outage time.   \\nIn a letter dated February 26, 2021 (ML21057A190), ExGen™s Mr. Pat Navin, FitzPatrick Site \\nVice President, provided a written response that acknowledged the circumstances that led to \\nthe use of the defective part at FitzPatrick.  However, in the response, ExGen also:  \\n(1)described Exelon™s business services group (which handled the part at Limerick and\\n\\nFitzPatrick) as being a separate corporate entity that works only under the specific facility\\nlicense at which the staff are physically located and disagreed the Criterion XV violation\\nrepresented a failure that was within FitzPatrick™s ability to foresee and prevent; (2) maintained\\nthat FitzPatrick™s receipt inspection of the parts was performed in accordance with Criterion VII\\nand other regulatory and self-imposed requirements; and (3) provided information and insights\\nrelated to the NRC™s preliminary characterization of the finding as being of low-to-moderate\\n1 Designation in parentheses refers to an Agency-wide Documents Access and Management System \\n(ADAMS) accession number.  Documents referenced in this letter are publicly-available using the \\naccession number in ADAMS. \\nD. Rhoades 2 \\n   (White) safety significance and stated that the significance of this finding could potentially be \\nbelow the threshold for a White determination.   \\n\\n In the February 26, 2021, letter, ExGen also indicated that the NRC™s description of the \\nCriterion VII apparent violation should be analyzed as a backfit under 10 CFR Part 50.109, \\nﬁBackfitting.ﬂ  On March 3, 2021, Mr. Daniel Collins, Director, Division of Reactor Projects and \\nMr. Eric D. Miller, Senior Resident Inspector, of my staff participated in a telephone call with \\nExGen™s Mr. Navin and Ms. Adriene Smith, FitzPatrick Director of Organizational Performance \\nand Regulatory Affairs, to obtain clarification on whether ExGen was requesting to enter the \\nbackfit appeal process described in NRC Management Directive 8.4, ﬁManagement of \\nBackfitting, Forward Fitting, Issue Finality, and Information Requests.ﬂ  Mr. Navin and Ms. Smith \\n\\nclarified during the call that ExGen was not requesting to enter the backfit appeal process at this \\n\\ntime but may choose to formally contest the violations or seek formal review of backfit concerns \\nafter the final significance determination is issued.  Therefore, the NRC evaluated the remaining \\nitems in ExGen™s February 26, 2021, letter.  A summary of ExGen™s positions as provided in its \\n\\nletter, the NRC™s response to the points raised by ExGen, and the details of the NRC™s \\nconclusion on the safety significance of this issue, are provided in Enclosure 1. \\n \\nAfter careful consideration of the information developed during the inspection and the additional \\ninformation provided in ExGen™s February 26, 2021, letter, the NRC staff has clarified the finding \\nand has concluded that the finding is appropriately characterized as White, a finding of low to \\n\\nmoderate safety significance.  The NRC staff has also determined that the finding involved \\n\\nviolations of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion VII, Criterion XV, and TS 3.5.1, and has \\nrevised those violations.  Our considerations in reaching these determinations included that: \\n1) the duration of the finding and violations should be changed from 2010 to 2017 in order to \\n\\nmore clearly focus on the time period in which Fitzpatrick had become part of the ExGen Fleet; \\n2) the NRC™s Enforcement Policy holds licensees accountable for the actions of their \\nemployees, contractors and vendors, and, therefore, the information in ExGen™s response \\n\\nregarding ExGen™s corporate structure and internal work practices (i.e. roles and responsib\\nilities \\nof ﬁbuyersﬂ and ﬁsellersﬂ) would not impact the assignment of this regulatory and enforcement \\naction to Fitzpatrick; and, 3) our review of the additional information provided relative to the risk \\nfor this finding did not materially impact our assessment.  In fact, a more comprehensive \\nanalysis of some of the information provided may have actually resulted in an overall increase in \\nour risk assessment.  It should be noted that the violations are strictly focused on compliance \\nwith 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, but should not be viewed as limiting or impacting any of your \\n\\ninternal practices as long as the applicable underlying regulatory requirements are satisfied. \\n The revised finding is provided in Enclosure 2.  You have 30 calendar days from the date of this \\n\\nletter to appeal the NRC staff™s determination of significance for the identified White finding. \\n\\nSuch appeals will be considered to have merit only if they meet the criteria given in the NRC \\nInspection Manual Chapter 0609, Attachment 2, ﬁProcess for Appealing NRC Characterization \\nof Inspection Findings (SDP Appeal Process),ﬂ effective January 25, 2021.  An appeal must be \\nsent in writing to the Regional Administrator, Region I, 2100 Renaissance Boulevard, Suite 100, \\nKing of Prussia, PA 19406. \\n \\nThe revised violations are cited in the Notice of Violation (Notice), provided as Enclosure 3. \\nBecause the violations are related, they have been categorized collectively as an enforcement \\nproblem, which is a way of documenting violations that share a common factor (i.e., cause and \\neffect) rather than citing individually.  By grouping such violations, the NRC applies appropriate \\nfocus on the underlying factors that caused the concerns, so that licensees can develop \\neffective and comprehensive corrective actions. \\n D. Rhoades 3 \\n   In accordance with the NRC Enforcement Policy, the Notice is considered an escalated \\nenforcement action because it is associated with a White finding.  You are required to respond \\nto this letter and should follow the instructions specified in the enclosed Notice when preparing \\n\\nyour response.  If you have additional information that you believe the NRC should consider, \\nyou may provide it in your response to the Notice.  The NRC review of your response to the \\nNotice will also determine whether further enforcement action is necessary to ensure \\n\\ncompliance with regulatory requirements. \\n\\n As a result of this White finding in the Mitigating Systems Cornerstone, the NRC has assessed \\nFitzPatrick to be in the Regulatory Response column of the NRC™s Reactor Oversight Process \\n\\nAction Matrix described in Inspection Manual Chapter 0305, ﬁOperating Reactor Assessment \\nProgram,ﬂ retroactive to the fourth calendar quarter of 2020.  The NRC plans to conduct a \\nsupplemental inspection for this finding in accordance with Inspection Procedure 95001,  \\n\\nﬁSupplemental Inspection Response to Action Matrix Column 2 (Regulatory Response) Inputs,ﬂ \\n\\neffective January 1, 2021, following Exelon™s notification of readiness for this inspection.  This \\ninspection is conducted to provide assurance that the root causes and contributing causes of \\nany performance issues are understood, the extent of condition is identified, and the corrective \\n\\nactions are sufficient to prevent recurrence. \\n In accordance with 10 CFR 2.390 of the NRC's ﬁRules of Practice and Procedure,ﬂ a copy of this \\nletter, its enclosure, and your response will be made available electronically for public inspection \\nin the NRC Public Document Room or from the NRC™s document system (ADAMS), accessible \\nfrom the NRC Web site at \\nhttp://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/adams.html\\n.

The NRC staff has also determined that the \\nfinding involved violations of 10 CFR Part 50 Appendix B, Criterion VII, Criterion XV, and \\nTS 3.5.1.   \\n However, the NRC staff has revised the finding and violations as described in Enclosures 2 \\nand 3.  Specifically, the NRC staff determined that:  1) the duration of the finding and violations \\nshould be changed from 2010 to 2017 in order to more clearly focus on the time period in which \\n\\nFitzpatrick had become part of the ExGen Fleet; 2) the NRC™s Enforcement Policy holds \\nlicensees accountable for the actions of their employees, contractors and vendors , and, \\ntherefore, the information in ExGen™s response regarding ExGen™s corporate structure and \\n\\ninternal work practices (i.e. roles and responsibilities of ﬁbuyersﬂ and ﬁsellersﬂ) would not impact \\nthe assignment of this regulatory and enforcement action to Fitzpatrick; and, 3) our review of the \\nadditional information provided relative to the risk for this finding did not materially impact our \\nassessment.  In fact, a more comprehensive analysis of some of the information provided may \\nhave actually resulted in an overall increase in our risk assessment.  It should be noted that the \\nviolations are strictly focused on compliance with 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, but should not \\n\\nbe viewed as limiting or impacting any of your internal practices as long as the applicable \\n\\nunderlying regulatory requirements are satisfied.  \\n SUMMARY OF EXGEN COMMENT Œ Independence of Licensed Facilities \\n ExGen stated that the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (JAF) licensed facility and the \\nLimerick Generating Station (LIM) licensed facility are legally independent entities with separate \\n\\nNRC-iss\\nued operating licenses that are supported by common resources as part of the \\nlarger ExGen fleet.  Support resources provided by the Exelon Business Services Company \\n(BSC) and which are assigned to individual licensed facilities are subject to the specific \\noperating license(s) of the facility to which they are assigned.  Therefore, the ability to foresee \\nand prevent the deficiency at LIM (seller) in 2010 should not be a basis for the deficiency being \\nforeseeable and preventable by JAF (buyer) in 2017. \\n NRC RESPONSE \\n Although each facility maintains separate NRC operating licenses, the JAF License No. DPR-59 \\n\\nand the LIM License Nos. NPF-39 and NPF-85 each specify Exelon Generation Company, LLC \\n\\nas the licensee.  However, more salient to this issue is that, upon joining the ExGen fleet in \\n2017, JAF began to utilize and have access to many of the same processes and programs as \\nLIM and other ExGen sites, including the corrective action program and component tracking \\n\\ndatabase.  The NRC identified that both of these programs contained information pertaining to \\nthe defective high pressure coolant injection (HPCI) system oil pressure control valve (PCV).   \\n \\nThe performance deficiency and apparent violations as originally presented in NRC inspection \\nreport number 05000333/2020012 described in full the circumstances that led to the installation \\nof the defective PCV at JAF.  This included describing the failures that occurred in 2010 at LIM \\nEnclosure 1 2 \\n  in response to a Title 10 of the \\nCode of Federal Regulations\\n (10 CFR) Part 21 notification when \\nstaff at that site did not segregate or place an electronic hold on the PCV, contrary to Exelon \\nprocedures.  The NRC staff considered the comments in ExGen™s February 26, 2021, letter \\npertaining to the finding and acknowledges that in 2017, ExGen staff could not have prevented \\n\\nthe process breakdown that occurred at LIM in 2010.  However, the NRC staff maintains that it \\nwas reasonable in 2017 for ExGen staff to have identified the information about the defective \\ncomponent that was readily available in the component tracking database and corrective action \\n\\ndatabase; common ExGen programs utilized by both sites.  For example, when receiving the \\n\\npart, ExGen staff at JAF accessed the component tracking database and removed a 'hold' due \\nto a shelf life concern.  The NRC staff identified that information about the Part 21 notification \\nwas readily available in the database and could reasonably be identified by a qualified \\n\\nprocurement engineer when performing a review of available information to address the ‚hold'. \\nAdditional detail about the NRC staff™s conclusions related to the finding is provided in the NRC \\nresponse to ExGen™s comment below related to the Criterion VII violation. \\n\\n \\nIn light of these considerations, the NRC staff revised the finding and violations to properly focus \\non the events that occurred in 2017.  The circumstances of the 2010 failures are still included in \\nthe Description Section of the finding as background information.  The revised finding and \\n\\nviolations are provided as Enclosures 2 and 3 to this final determination report. \\n SUMMARY OF EXGEN COMMENT - 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion XV \\n The 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion XV violation and associated performance deficiency \\noccurred at the LIM licensed facility in 2010 by support resources working in direct support of \\nthe LIM operating licenses.  The Inspection Report identified an apparent violation of 10 CFR \\n\\nPart 50, Appendix B, Criterion XV, \"Nonconforming Materials, Parts, or Components\" based on \\nthe failure to properly identify and segregate non-conforming material that was identified and \\ncommunicated to LIM by a General Electric-Hitachi (GEH) 10 CFR Part 21 notification.  The JAF \\n\\nCausal Analysis to address the HPCI failure determined that as part of LIM™s response to the \\n2010 GEH 10 CFR Part 21 notification, LIM personnel failed to follow procedure requirements to \\nplace an electronic hold and segregate the defective part.  This allowed the defective part to be \\nsold to JAF in 2017 without being notified of the deficiency. \\n NRC RESPONSE \\n As described above, the NRC staff acknowledges that prior to 2017, ExGen staff at JAF could \\nnot have prevented the 2010 failures at LIM related to identifying and segregating the \\nnon-conforming PCV since JAF was not transferred to ExGen until March 2017.  Therefore, the \\nfinding and the related Criterion XV violation have been revised accordingly.  However, the NRC \\nstaff maintains that the remaining aspect of the finding and Criterion XV violation is attributable \\nto JAF.  Specifically, the regulation requires that licensees establish measures to control \\n\\nmaterials, parts, or components which do not conform to requirements in order to prevent their \\n\\ninadvertent use or installation and to accept, reject, repair, or rework nonconforming items.  \\nRegardless of the past failures to identify and segregate the nonconforming PCV, in 2017 \\nExGen again did not control and reject the nonconforming component, resulting in its \\n\\nacceptance and installation at JAF.  The NRC staff maintains that JAF is responsible for this \\nfailure.   \\n In particular, the activities performed in 2017 to transfer the part between LIM and JAF and to \\naccept and use the part at JAF were performed in support of ExGen and the JAF license.  As  \\nEnclosure 1 3 \\n  noted in Section 1.2 of the NRC Enforcement Policy, it is NRC policy to hold licensees \\nresponsible for the acts of their employees, contractors, or vendors and their employees, and \\nthe NRC may cite the licensee for violations committed by its employees, contractors, or \\n\\nvendors and their employees.  Therefore, regardless of the physical locations of the involved \\n\\nstaff, their reporting authority under the greater Exelon Corporation structure, or the typical \\nresponsibilities of these individuals to support the licensed facilities at which they are located, \\nwhen individuals are directed by a licensee to perform activities that affect that NRC licensee, \\n\\nthat licensee assumes the responsibility for violations caused by the individuals™ actions or \\ninactions. \\n \\nFurthermore, the NRC staff maintains that, in consideration of the common procedures and \\nprocesses shared between LIM and JAF, it was reasonable for ExGen staff at JAF to have \\nforeseen and prevented the acceptance and use of the nonconforming PCV and that ExGen \\nstaff at JAF should have identified and rejected the defective item during receipt inspection \\n\\nactivities conducted in December 2017.  Additional information about the finding is provided in \\nthe NRC response to ExGen™s comment below related to the Criterion VII violation. \\n SUMMARY OF EXGEN COMMENT - 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion VII \\n The receipt inspection completed at JAF in 2017 was performed consistent with the \\nrequirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion VII and the JAF Quality Assurance \\nProgram (QAP) requirements and, therefore, does not constitute a failure to follow a regulatory \\nor self-imposed standard.  The Inspection Report identified a Violation of 10 CFR Part 50, \\n\\nAppendix B, Criterion VII, \"Control of Purchased Material, Equipment, and Servicesﬂ based on \\nthe failure to identify, during receipt inspection, that the purchased valve was the subject of a \\n2010 10 CFR Part 21 notification.  ExGen has confirmed that the JAF receipt inspection was \\nperformed consistent with the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion VII and \\n\\nthe JAF QAP and, therefore, was not a failure to follow a regulatory or self-imposed standard.  \\nAdditionally, without further actions beyond these requirements, the receipt inspector could not \\nreasonably have been expected to identify that the valve was the subject of the 2010 10 CFR \\n\\nPart 21 notification based on the documentation provided by the seller (LIM). \\n NRC RESPONSE \\n Title 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion VII requires that licensees establish measures to \\nassure that purchased material, equipment, and services, whether purchased directly or through \\ncontractors and subcontractors, conform to procurement documents.  However, the measures \\nimplemented by ExGen in 2017 did not identify the nonconformance of the PCV.  A licensee™s \\nQAP and the processes developed to implement that program provide the mechanism for the \\nlicensee to comply with 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B; they do not serve as replacements or \\nalternatives to these regulatory requirements.  Therefore, if a licensee™s QAP, or implementation \\nof the QAP, fails to ensure that the licensee meets an Appendix B requirement, the licensee is \\nin violation of that requirement. \\n \\nThe NRC staff maintains that, in this case, the receipt inspection performed at JAF (the intended \\nmeasure to assure purchased material conformed to procurement documents) was not sufficient \\nto meet this Appendix B requirement.  Specifically, as noted in the finding description in \\n\\nEnclosure 2, the ExGen Quality Assurance Program Manual (QAPM), Revision 0, Section A, \\nﬁManagement,ﬂ stated, ﬁthe requirements and commitments contained in the QAPM are \\nmandatory and must be implemented, enforced, and adhered to by all individuals and \\n\\norganizations.ﬂ  Section 5, ﬁProcurement Verification,ﬂ required a program to be established and \\nEnclosure 1 4 \\n  implemented to verify the quality of purchased items and services.  Section 6, ﬁIdentification and \\nControl of Items,ﬂ required a program to be established and implemented to identify and control \\nitems to prevent the use of incorrect or defective items.  The receipt inspection, conducted using \\n\\nExGen Procedure SM-AA-102, Revision 23, ﬁWarehouse Operations,ﬂ implemented these \\n\\nprocurement verification requirements.  This receipt inspection did not identify that the PCV \\ncontained a defective diaphragm. \\n \\nThe NRC staff maintains that it was reasonably within ExGen™s ability to foresee and prevent the \\nuse of the nonconforming PCV at JAF.  In particular, information about the defective diaphragm \\nwas located in both the ExGen component tracking database and corrective action database.  \\n\\nThe inspectors reviewed the component tracking database and determined that the issue report \\n(IR) associated with the 10 CFR Part 21 report should have been reasonably identified by a \\nqualified procurement engineer.  Notably, when receiving the part, ExGen staff at JAF accessed \\nthe component tracking database and removed a 'hold' due to a shelf life concern.  The NRC \\n\\nstaff identified that information about the Part 21 notification was readily available in the \\ndatabase and could reasonably be identified by a qualified procurement engineer when  \\nperforming a review of available information to address the ‚hold.'  The staff also noted that the \\n\\ninformation was available to staff involved with the transfer of the component to JAF through the \\nExGen corrective action program, because the issue report was noted in the component \\ntracking database and had not been resolved at the time the part was moved to and accepted at \\nJAF.  As such, it was reasonable for ExGen staff responsible for, and in control of, both sides of \\nthe internal transaction that occurred in order to effect the movement of the PCV from LIM to \\nJAF in 2017 to have identified the Part 21 information related to the PCV.\\n  SUMMARY OF EXGEN COMMENT Œ\\n Uncertainties Input for Significance Determination \\n ExGen provided new information and additional insights which the licensee stated reduce some \\n\\nof the calculational uncertainties that weigh into the Significance Determination (SDP).  ExGen \\nindicated that the uncertainties are smaller than characterized in the NRC inspection report and \\ncould potentially result in a significance below the threshold for a White determination. \\n\\n \\n1. The JAF Engineering staff has performed additional engineering reviews related to the \\nmaximum oil leak rate from the HPCI system PCV which provide information supporting the \\nleak rate used in the JAF SDP analysis. \\n 2. JAF Operations staff have gathered and documented additional timeline and performance \\ndata which better characterizes the uncertainty in the analysis of operator credit for \\n\\nidentification and restoration of HPCI oil. \\n 3. JAF Operations and Engineering staff have validated information regarding Main Control \\nRoom (MCR) staff operation of HPCI during transient conditions. \\n 4. JAF Engineering and Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) Staff provided information \\nregarding incorporation of Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) fire realisms and the \\n\\nassociated reduction in fire ignition frequencies (FIFs) for areas that are risk important \\nrelative to HPCI operation. \\n NRC RESPONSE \\n  The NRC staff reviewed the information in ExGen™s written response and determined that the \\nproper characterization of this finding overall remains of low-to-moderate safety significance  \\nEnclosure 1 5 \\n  (White).  The NRC staff agreed that ExGen™s use of revised fire ignition frequencies from those \\nused in the NRC risk determination was appropriate.  However, the slight reduction in the \\ncalculated increase in core damage frequency (CDF) due to a lower fire risk estimate did not \\n\\nimpact the overall NRC risk assessment and significance determination process conclusion.  \\n\\nThe following details the NRC™s assessment regarding the four areas of input provided by \\nExGen for consideration in the SDP:  \\n 1. Calculated Maximum Oil Leak \\n NRC Response \\n ExGen utilized a slightly lower minimum leak rate of 0.19 gallons per minute (gpm) with a \\nmaximum leak rate of 2.8 gpm, which considered higher operating oil temperatures when the \\n\\nsystem would be in service.  The NRC SDP analysis utilized a minimum leak rate of 0.28 gpm \\n\\nwith a maximum leak rate of 3.65 gpm to arrive at a weighted leak rate estimate which would \\naccount for the probability of an early re-positioning of the degraded, nonconforming Part 21 \\npressure control valve (PCV).  As stated in the detailed risk evaluation (DRE), the NRC used \\n\\nindustry data to estimate a probability that an early HPCI system trip would lead to a large leak \\nfrom the PCV.  The early probabilistic trip of the HPCI system was determined to be 0.15 \\nthrough several different methodologies as described within the DRE.  However, the DRE \\n\\ndescribed how this number may be an underestimation of the actual data, even though used in \\nthe development of the weighted leak rate estimation.  It is not uncommon for the HPCI system \\nto be tripped early for level control during postulated events and a sample of industry data \\n\\nreviewed, reflected that an early HPCI trip could occur up to 50 percent of the time based on a \\n\\nreview of a sample of Licensee Event Reports.  This illustrates in part, the uncertainty with \\nevaluating what leak rate would have existed within this degraded part during a postulated event \\nwhere HPCI would have responded.  The NRC noted in the DRE that the initial leak rate \\n\\nsubsequently identified by ExGen was reported as one pint in two minutes, although computer \\ninformation provided to the analysts indicated the pump was run with the PCV at normal \\npressure for only one minute.  Of further concern related to the accuracy of ExGen™s estimated \\n\\nleak rate was the inconsistency between the leak rate assumed in the analysis and the initial \\n\\nleak of 0.25 gpm leak rate that was verbally report\\ned to the resident inspector staff.  As a result, \\nthe analyst determined that the leak rate values provided in the ExGen analysis and follow-up \\nletter were uncertain, underestimated the actual leak rate, and are not viewed as credible. \\n  When ExGen attempted to quantify the leak rate through a second start of the auxiliary oil \\npump, the pump was secured after 30 seconds based on a much larger leak rate that \\n\\noverwhelmed the collection apparatus used to measure the oil quantity.  The 1.3 gpm was \\nbased on the captured oil for the 30 second run.  The analysts noted that the second run was \\nonce again performed with the auxiliary oil pump (AOP), which develops a lower pressure \\n\\n(85-95 psig) than if the shaft driven oil pump (SDOP) was started (105-110 psig) during an \\n\\nactual run.  The output of the controlling pump pressure is controlled by a main oil system PCV, \\nwhich will control downstream pressure to 38 psig.  However, there is some response time by \\nthe main PCV resulting in a slightly higher pressure pulse (i.e. stress) that was expected to have \\n\\nbeen absorbed by the downstream nonconforming PCV diaphragm.  This further adds to the \\nuncertainty, and validity of any measured oil leak when it was performed under non-operating \\nconditions.  Actual turbine operating conditions result in different dynamics relative to the oil \\n\\nsystem, with the potential for an even larger tear on the weakened nonconforming pressure \\ncontrol valve diaphragm.   \\n  Enclosure 1 6 \\n   Notwithstanding the multitude of uncertainties mentioned above, if the NRC were to adjust their \\nweighted leak rate estimate by using a maximum leakage capped at 2.8 gpm or even slightly \\nlower as suggested by ExGen, this would have an inconsequential effect on the amount of time \\n\\nassumed and calculated within the NRC DRE before the SDOP and AOP would lose suction \\n\\ndue to the loss of oil inventory.  The NRC determined the information provided by ExGen would \\nhave no substantive impact in this area, as the uncertainties overwhelm the ExGen™s \\nengineering analysis, including the inputs used in that analysis, for the calculated maximum oil \\n\\nleak rate.  \\n 2. Oil Leak Mitigation/Credited Operator Actions \\n  ExGen™s position is that giving no credit for operators to recover the HPCI system in the event of \\nan oil leak does not recognize proceduralized actions that the operators would take and be \\n\\ncapable of executing.  ExGen contends that operating procedure, OP-15, Revision 68, \\nSection G.10, ﬁAdding Oil to HPCI Sump with HPCI in Service,ﬂ provides explicit guidance to \\nmaintain oil in the running level band.  ExGen states that operators performed a timed \\nwalkdown for recovery actions to maintain adequate oil level in the HPCI sump in the event the \\n\\nHPCI PCV diaphragm had a tear.  The walkdown was reported to result in operators \\nsuccessfully restoring oil in approximately 27.5 minutes.  ExGen stated that with regards to the \\ntime until the leak is located, there are several considerations.  OP-AA-103-102, ﬁWatch-\\n\\nStanding Practicesﬂ outlines expectations for non-licensed operators to monitor all equipment \\nthey are responsible for.  This procedure also establishes post-start and post-shutdown system \\nwalk down requirements to ensure expected system and components response.  Lastly, ExGen \\n\\nstated that if the control room received the HPCI Turbine Bearing Oil Pressure Low annunciator \\n\\nand HPCI operation is required, the main control room (MCR) operators would respond as \\nfollows: \\n  1. If the HPCI Auxiliary Oil Pump did not auto-start, then attempt to manually start the \\npump from the control room. \\n 2. If the annunciator does not clear, then send an operator locally to investigate the reason \\nfor the loss of oil pressure. \\n 3. The field operator would observe a large amount of oil at the HPCI skid and check HPCI \\noil sump level. \\n 4. Operations would perform actions per OP-15, Section F ﬁShutdownﬂ to secure the AOP \\nwhen the HPCI turbine is not rotating. \\n 5. The control room would direct the field operator to add oil to the HPCI sump. \\n  ExGen™s position is that the oil leak can be effectively managed with readily available equipment \\nand procedurally directed operator actions.   \\n  NRC Response \\n  ExGen procured a Vendor Report, EC-631895, ﬁTechnical Evaluation to Support Availability of \\n\\nHPCI System Due to Oil Leak in PCV-12,ﬂ dated June 18, 2020, which was developed \\nregarding the oil leak and determined that there is a nominal 1-inch drop in the oil sump for \\nevery 13 gallons of oil.  During the postulated events evaluated in an SDP such as this, there \\n\\nare multiple assumed failures of various equipment that lead to a path of core damage.  For \\nEnclosure 1 7 \\n   these events, various equipment may be automatically started from emergency diesel \\ngenerators to the reactor core isolation cooling system (RCIC), HPCI, and a multitude of other \\nequipment.  Thus, there can be a multitude of potential response areas required for plant \\n\\noperators, which directly affects their response time.  As noted in the calculation of the \\n\\nmaximum oil leak section above, a probabilistic leak rate could be in the area of 0.7 gpm to an \\nassumed maximum leakrate in the area of 2.8 gpm or higher, depending on the heatup rate of \\nthe oil and any other factors which would have contributed to the PCV diaphragm tear.  As \\n\\nnoted above, a plant operator may enter the HPCI cubicle and check the oil standpipe and with \\nvarious potential oil leak rates possible, the indicated level would likely be well within the sight \\nglass, with zero other operational abnormalities occurring or noticeable, including HPCI turbine \\n\\nand pump bearing temperatures.  This PCV is not located in the front of the machine and \\ndepending on when an operator would check the machine, this leak may not be identified.   \\n The NRC noted that the design of the HPCI control oil system at FitzPatrick does not have a \\n\\nsump low-level alarm.  Additionally, during a leak, it is apparent that other critical early cues of \\nhigher bearing temperatures, low oil pressures, and low sump level would not be available \\nthrough instrumentation and would not provide ensured identification of a notable leak prior to \\n\\ncomplete failure of the system to operate.  Additionally, the assumed leak rate in this SDP \\nevaluation has unquantifiable uncertainties as mentioned above, with the potential to have been \\nlarger than measured in the relatively colder non-turbine operating condition when the tear was \\n\\ninitially generated.  The sequence of events per this design and nonconforming PCV, would be \\na continued leak at an uncertain rate, with a silent effect on the system, the controls, and the \\nannunciators, as there would be no abnormalities until the system would terminate operation \\n\\ndue to complete suction loss of the shaft-driven oil pump (SDOP).  As noted above, the only \\n\\nalarm or cue would be the turbine bearing oil pressure, which would likely not annunciate even \\nwith a large leak, due to a controlling PCV maintaining 38 psig upstream, which would serve to \\ncompensate for the degraded PCV diaphragm leak, and continue to provide downstream flow \\n\\nand pressure to the bearings.   \\n  The first absolute automatic cue for the operators would be this alarm, but it appears, per the \\n\\ndesign, that it would come in after the SDOP would lose its suction prime due to low oil level, \\n\\nresulting in a loss of discharge pressure.  This would drop pressure to the control valve actuator \\nrotating gear pump and result in closure of the control steam valves as well as the turbine stop \\nvalve.  The SDOP will then spin down, with the main auxiliary oil pump (AOP) starting on low oil \\n\\npressure at around 35 psig.  A further uncertainty is the AOP will start and run with no suction \\nhead, likely cavitating as it continues to run without an adequate oil supply.  As noted above, the \\noperators would actually be instructed to start the AOP if it didn™t auto start even with an \\n\\ninadequate suction pressure.  When an operator would arrive in the area, there would be 60 to \\n65 gallons or more of hot oil within the skid area.  There would be no leak visible or identifiable, \\nbecause the nonconforming PCV would have closed on loss of pressure and there would be no \\n\\npressure to drive any further leakage. \\n\\n  In this condition, it would not be obvious if there had been a pipe crack, a severe crack in the \\nvarious control oil piping and fittings, or complete failure of the oil system, and it™s likely \\n\\noperators would be challenged to identify where the oil came from with 120 degree oil \\npotentially scattered within the skid area.  Furthermore, there is another uncertainty with how \\nlong the AOP would have been running, as it does not automatically receive a trip signal, \\n\\nresulting in cavitation without any oil supply and/or if it would have damaged itself.  ExGen \\nstates they would enter section G.10, ﬁAdding Oil to HPCI Oil Sump with HPCI in Service.ﬂ  With \\nthis scenario, however, HPCI would not be in-service as it would be secured automatically \\n\\n(steam valves closed) due to the failure, contrary to the procedure entry definition/description.  \\nEnclosure 1 8 \\n   OP-15, G.10, as written is intended to gather pre-filtered oil and if not prefiltered, to obtain an oil \\nfiltration device and extension cord and fill an oil transfer container from labeled oil barrels in the \\nlube oil storage room per engineering direction.  Again, it should be noted, it is very likely the \\n\\nleak source would be difficult to determine at this point.  Additionally, hooking up a funnel to a \\n\\nleak source appears to not be proceduralized and the placement would not even be recognized \\nin this scenario, not to mention the effects of running the oil system below the AOP suction \\ncapability, with air entrainment or other kinds of potential adverse effects on the AOP and motor.   \\n\\n  Lastly, if recovery of HPCI in this situation became a priority as suggested in ExGen™s response, \\nan operator would have to fill the sump by finding a portable pump along with electricity for \\n\\nﬁsaidﬂ pump (i.e. for LOOP scenarios there likely isn™t normal outlet power), then keep-up with \\nthe potential large leak rate while looking for the leak point.  Then, once the leak point is \\nidentified, the operator needs to build the apparatus to route the leak to the sump.  Additionally, \\na recovery event such as this includes a human error probability (HEP) assessment which \\n\\nwould need to be analyzed on how it may affect the most dominating basic event in this risk \\nanalysis (failure to depressurize event).  This scenario will take cognitive ability to detect what \\nhappened, make decisions and to understand the success path to restore the high pressure \\n\\nsystem, including its recovery feasibility.  In core damage scenarios or cutsets, this HPCI \\nrecovery event would be accompanied by the SPAR model depressurization basic event \\n(ADS-XHE-XM-MDEPR).  This event would now likely justify including a diagnosis as well as an \\naction assessment due to the cognitive nature of understanding and deciding if the operator \\ncould restore a high pressure injection source in time while reactor vessel level is lowering, \\nwhile waiting until EOPs direct depressurization with the potential thought that HPCI is close to \\n\\nbeing brought back to service.  Adding this diagnostic piece to the normal depressurization \\n\\nevent in the SPAR model raises the potential for a higher failure probability by almost an order \\nof magnitude even considering extra time for diagnosis and action to depressurize in the \\nSPAR-H calculation.  Therefore, by including a HPCI recovery event, the failure to depressurize \\n\\nevent could now be considered for increased failure probability due to the diagnosis needed in \\nthis situation.  A rough calculation has shown that this can increase one of the dominating \\npostulated core damage event scenarios such as a loss-of-condenser-heat sink for a 38-day \\nexposure (DRE risk of 4E-7/yr) to an increased risk of 2E-6/yr for this one event.    \\n\\n  In summary, recovery credit including the challenges accompanying this condition, should likely \\nbe considered for an increased failure in the ADS-XHE-XM-MDEPR basic event, which may \\nhave a significant increase in the end result of the previous risk determination and make the \\neffects of recovery credit a non-substantive issue relative to lowering the calculated increase in \\nCDF/yr for this event.  \\n\\n  Notwithstanding this, based on the above uncertainties, the lack of cues within the system \\ndesign, the uncertainties with the leak rate, the uncertainty with the timing and ability to detect \\n\\nthe leak through a walkdown post event for many systems, operator recovery was determined \\n\\nnot to be a feasible action in the primary base case evaluation of the condition, and the \\ninformation provided has no substantive effect on that conclusion.  However, as is always \\nprudent, the NRC analysts performed a sensitivity study using appropriate considerations of \\n\\nrecovery difficulty in the DRE (Cases 3 and 4, used 1 out of 5 recovery) within the report giving \\nsome credit for recovery.  This sensitivity did not account for an evaluation of increasing the \\nfailure to depressurize (basic event) through the model.  If this became a base assumption the \\n\\nSRA believes it would be appropriate to re-analyze for the above consideration which would \\nlikely result in a notable overall increase of the calculated CDF for the HPCI PCV failure.   \\n  \\n Enclosure 1 9 \\n   3. HPCI Operations During Transient Conditions \\n  ExGen has stated that while operating HPCI with drywell pressure greater than 2.7 psig, the full \\n\\nflow path test return valves close to divert all flow to the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV).  To \\n\\ncontrol RPV water level, the main control room (MCR) operators would dial the flow controller \\nback as needed to control the injection rate and maintain level within the required bands \\nestablished in the station Emergency Operating Procedures (EOPs).   \\n\\n  ExGen also acknowledged that running the HPCI pump on minimum flow with the full-flow test \\nreturn valves closed, is not preferred for long term reliability.  However, in response to transient \\n\\nand accident conditions, operations in this manner is consistent with guidance in station EOPs \\nby ensuring the HPCI system remains available as a high-pressure water source.  As such, \\nMCR operators would not secure HPCI if it was running on minimum flow nor would the pump \\n\\nbe damaged during a transient or accident response to the point that sufficient flow could not be \\n\\ndeveloped. \\n  NRC response \\n  The NRC acknowledges that the station EOPs direct level control within the proper bands, using \\nany systems that may be available.  The NRC also recognizes the difficulty with controlling level \\n\\nusing HPCI for various events.  This is illustrated in the Fitzpatrick RCIC System, B 3.5.3, \\ntechnical specification basis document referring to Actions A.1 and A.2.  The Bases states for \\ntransients and certain abnormal events (i.e. which drive the NRC™s risk SDP evaluation), with no \\n\\nloss-of-coolant-accident, RCIC (as opposed to HPCI) is the preferred source of makeup coolant \\n\\nbecause of its relatively small capacity, which allows easier control of the RPV water level.  \\nThus, there is a limited time allowed to restore RCIC to an operable status.  This simply \\nconfirms the challenge of operating HPCI under conditions where there may be lower makeup \\n\\nrequirements. \\n  OP-15, Revision 68, ﬁHigh Pressure Coolant Injection,ﬂ System Description, describes the \\ndesign operating conditions for when pump discharge water flows through the feedwater line \\n\\ninto the RPV, that HPCI will continue to inject 4250 gpm until RPV water level reaches \\n222.5 inches, then HPCI will trip on high RPV water level.  If RPV water level lowers to \\n126.5 inches, HPCI will auto-initiate following a high RPV water level trip.  This simply explains \\n\\nthe automatic design of the system where it is designed to continually, with no operator action, \\ninject, trip and reset as required.  However, the NRC understands that this is not the preferred \\noperation or response as operators are trained and instructed to control RPV level within the \\n\\nproper station EOP designated band without allowing HPCI trips; this description from OP-15 \\nsimply illustrates the design of the system. \\n  \\nAs documented in the NRC SDP evaluation, while we have found no restriction within the \\n\\nFitzpatrick operating procedures specific to HPCI operating in the minimum flow mode taking \\nwater from the condensate storage tank and depleting it to the torus, there are some \\nuncertainties with this operating mode (i.e., low flow only available).  Specifically, there are Terry \\nTurbine Maintenance guides and technical reports/industry guidance applicable to HPCI, which \\nrecognize that the design basis is to deliver constant flowrate to the RPV over a wide range of \\nreactor pressures.  If reduced vessel injection flowrate (i.e., match decay heat for non-LOCA \\n\\ntransients), is required to control level, this is an off-design operation and is time-consuming and \\nrequires operator attention to control.  The pump head versus flow characteristics are relatively \\nflat as flowrate decreases below rated volume and it is recognized that reduced flowrates below \\n\\na nominal 75 percent below design, will likely cause system instability within the control system.  \\nEnclosure 1 10 \\n   Additionally, typical Terry turbine guidance cautions that the pump/turbine controls should not \\nbe operated less than 50 percent of rated flow for a sustained period of time.  Further guidance \\nstates that operating at 10 to 20 percent minimum flow is intended for startup and shutdown \\n\\nonly and severe internal cavitation at high head conditions can result in pump damage. \\n\\n According to ExGen™s above statement, operators would not secure HPCI in the minimum flow \\nmode and therefore may have run the pump in this off-normal condition for long periods of time \\n\\nin postulated events.  There are several uncertainties with the definitive nature of this statement.  \\nFirst, OP-15, Attachment 4, HPCI AUTO INITIATION VERIFICATION and SUBSEQUENT \\nACTIONS, recognizes appropriately, that when operation of HPCI below 3000 gpm is required, \\n\\nmonitoring of the system operation frequently is required to ensure proper operation and if \\noscillations occur then the system is to be operated with the controller in manual.  The NRC \\nrecognizes that if oscillations occur, the flow controller will result in increasing and decreasing \\nspeed changes.  This by itself would create the need for the main PCV within the oil system to \\n\\nrespond to control to 38 psig with changes in the SDOP speed.  Any small delays in PCV \\nresponse could result in pressure changes and or small stress changes to the downstream \\ndegraded PCV diaphragm.  Additionally, OP-15, Attachment 6, ﬁHPCI Operation Flowchart,ﬂ \\n\\nrequires verifying HPCI parameters per Section D of OP-15.  These parameters include \\nmonitoring outboard-end and pump-end vibration levels to ensure less than 0.385 inches per \\nsecond.   \\n\\n  Because this operation may occur for extensive time periods through a mission time up to \\n15 hours, long periods of HPCI operation can be expected in this condition.  The HPCI system \\nis not normally run for long periods on minimum flow and hence there likely is no data available \\n\\non system effects.  Therefore, an additional uncertainty would be if this mode of operation (long \\nterm minimum flow operation) would challenge the procedure™s acceptable pump vibration \\nlevels with the expected cavitation with the pump internals.  If vibration levels would be \\n\\nexceeded, this would be a decision point with regard to operation of the system (i.e. should the \\nsystem be used to fill to the EOP level zone at higher rates, then secured and restarted when \\nboil-off reduced level back to the lower end of the control zone).  It is also unknown how internal \\n\\npump cavitation may affect the HPCI skid itself and if there could be any adverse effects on \\n\\nresonance vibration on the nonconforming degraded PCV diaphragm condition through the \\nmission time, while running in this off-normal condition.  It should be noted if there would be an \\nadverse effect on the nonconforming PCV; this could extend the exposure time going \\n\\nbackwards, factoring in all of the uncertainties mentioned above. \\n  In addition, the DRE documented the basis for the 0.15 trip rate of the turbine based on industry \\n\\noperating data, which is relevant to the expected operator responses for operation of the HPCI \\nturbine.     \\n  \\nIn summary, the statement concluding the operators would stay on minimum flow has \\n\\nuncertainty with the ability to do that, considering the system is designed for much higher \\nflowrates per its design.  Lastly, extended operation on minimum flow will deplete the preferred \\ncondensate storage tank (CST) suction source to the torus, resulting in additional challenges of \\n\\nCST source availability for the longer- term mission and also on control rod drive pump \\ncapability as the CST is depleted for certain events.  Because of the above uncertainties, the \\nNRC SDP used an exposure time above 38 days (i.e., 59 days) for only a very few applicable \\n\\nevents.     \\n  Notwithstanding the many uncertainties identified above with the definitive statements of not \\nsecuring HPCI if operating on extended minimum flow conditions, the NRC in response to this  \\nEnclosure 1 11 \\n   letter and statement of expected operations, revised the 59-day exposure times for the \\nevents to 38 days to determine its impact on the SDP.  The result was there was an \\ninconsequential difference for the few events where the longer exposure time was used and \\n\\nthe final determination of a low to moderate risk significant issue remained unchanged. \\n\\n 4. Fire Analysis \\n The JAF PRA staff developed and used updated fire modeling ignition frequencies for the fire \\nareas reviewed in the NRC SDP analysis.  The NRC analysis had used fire scenario \\nfrequencies listed in the Fitzpatrick Fire PRA notebook at the time of the evaluation \\n\\n(JF-PRA-021.11 ﬁJames A. FitzPatrick - Fire Probabilistic Risk Analysis Summary & \\nQuantitative Notebook,ﬂ Revision 2).  ExGen™s position is that the fire ignition frequencies in the \\nJAF analysis should be used because they are based on more realistic fire modeling \\n\\nfrequencies. \\n\\n NRC response \\n  The NRC concurs that the JAF updated fire frequencies would result in smaller frequencies and \\nreduction in the \\nNRC fire model risk assessment.  The SPAR Delta CDF increase was \\ncalculated to be 9.9E-7/yr.  Using the revised frequencies, the Delta CDF in Table 2 of ExGen™s \\n\\nletter resulted in a total of 5.6E-7/yr risk increase.  It should be noted fire risk was not a \\ndominant contributor to this risk assessment. \\n NRC Overall Risk Determination Conclusion \\n  The NRC does not believe the information and analysis presented by ExGen is substantive in its \\nnature in reducing the uncertainties and/or influencing a change in the final determination of \\n\\nsignificance below the threshold for a White determination, in part, for the various reasons \\nmentioned above. \\n  \\nHowever, the NRC analysts reviewed all the information presented by ExGen in their \\n\\nFebruary 26, 2021 letter and performed a final sensitivity using all the suggested considerations \\nprovided by ExGen™s supporting information. \\n  \\nThe NRC analyst™s final sensitivity revised the exposure times from 59 days to 38 days based \\non the potential for survival of HPCI remaining on minimum flow and never being tripped or \\nsecured during the course of mission times up to 24 hours.  The NRC analysts used the HPCI \\n\\nrecovery credit (0.8) as documented in the original DRE, however it should be noted this was \\nnot the base case and they did not evaluate the effect this could have or potential increase on \\nthe dominant basic event, (failure to depressurize), as mentioned above in the recovery section.  \\n\\nFinally, the analysts used the lower fire risk increase presented by ExGen.  With all these \\n\\nsensitivity changes, the increase in risk for internal events, flooding, fire and seismic resulted in \\na revised conditional increase in CDF/yr of a nominal 2E-6/yr.  It should be noted these changes \\nwere only performed as a sensitivity as the NRC determined the information presented had no \\n\\nsubstantive effect on the risk outcome (i.e., 3E-6/yr) and did not change the original SRA PRA \\nmodeling assumptions, except for the fire ignition frequencies used.  All other PRA modeling \\nassumptions have been documented and justified within the existing DRE.   \\n\\n  Although some of the information provided within this letter may suggest there could be a \\npotential for an increase in risk over that which was originally calculated, the analysts believed \\nEnclosure 1 12 \\n   the original estimate remains a valid best-estimate given the information and uncertainties \\nrelevant to this issue. \\n RISK SUMMARY \\n  In summary, the NRC staff carefully reviewed the responses provided by ExGen.  The NRC \\n\\nstaff acknowledges and considered ExGen™s viewpoint, but ultimately determined that the new \\n\\ninformation did not alter the NRC™s original risk assessment outcome or methodology as \\ndescribed in Inspection Report 05000333/2020012, dated January 21, 2021 (ADAMS Accession \\nNumber:  ML21020A108).  Based upon the additional information provided, the NRC staff \\n\\nconcluded that the finding remains appropriately characterized as White. \\n     ENCLOSURE 2 \\n REVISED FINDING \\n Defective Part Results in High Pressure Coolant Injection System Pressure Control Valve \\nFailure \\nCornerstone Significance Cross-Cutting Aspect Report Section \\nMitigating Systems \\n White NOV  \\n05000333/   \\n2020012-01  \\nOpen \\nEA-20-138 \\n[H.1] - Resources 71153 \\nThe inspectors documented a self-revealed White finding and related violations of Title 10 of \\nthe \\nCode of Federal Regulations \\n(10 CFR) Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion VII, ﬁControl of \\nPurchased Material, Equipment, and Services,ﬂ and Criterion XV, ﬁNonconforming Materials, \\n\\nParts, or Components,ﬂ  because Exelon Generation, LLC (ExGen) did not adhere to \\nrequirements to ensure that a high pressure \\ncoolant injection (HPCI)\\n system oil pressure \\ncontrol valve (PCV) conformed to all procurement requirements.  Consequently, ExGen did \\n\\nnot reject the defective PCV, as identified in a 10 CFR Part 21 notification.  As a result, \\nExGen accepted and installed the part at FitzPatrick on December 16, 2017.  The HPCI \\nsystem was subsequently declared inoperable on April 10, 2020, during a planned \\n\\nsurveillance test due to the defect identified in the Part 21 notification.  This also caused the \\n\\nHPCI system to be inoperable for greater than its technical specification allowed outage time \\nin accordance with NRC reportability guidelines. \\n Description:  The HPCI system at FitzPatrick provides an emergency source of water \\nfollowing a transient or accident.  This high pressure source of coolant is delivered from two \\nwater sources using steam generated from the reactor to drive the associated turbine and \\npump.  The HPCI system pump can deliver up to 4,250 gallons per minute and may be \\noperated across a wide range of reactor pressures.  The HPCI system pump and turbine are \\n\\nsupported by an oil system designed to lubricate bearings and provide adequate pressure to \\ncontrol the steam turbine stop and control valves. \\n \\nOn November 7, 2017, the NRC issued Order NRC-2017-0177 establishing Exelon \\nGeneration, LLC (ExGen) as the owner, operator, and holder of the FitzPatrick Renewed \\nFacility Operating License No. DPR-59.  ExGen owns or co-owns and operates 22 nuclear \\n\\nreactors at 13 sites in four states.  As stated, in part, in the application dated August 18, 2016 \\n(ML16235A081), and approved by NRC Order NRC-2017-0177, ExGen provided that:  \\n ﬁ–integration of the operation of FitzPatrick with Exelon Generation™s \\n\\ncurrent fleet of nuclear power plants, will allow consolidated operations of \\nFitzPatrick and the other nuclear units operated by Exelon Generation.  \\nThe seamless integration of FitzPatrick into Exelon Generation™s \\n\\noperations will create a single organization with responsibility over all of \\nthe plants for which it is the licensed operator.ﬂ \\n Exelon Corporation, the parent company of ExGen, also operates a central supply \\norganization (Business Services Company, LLC (BSC)) that provides support for day-to-day \\nnuclear station (site) operations with a dual reporting relationship to the centralized supply \\n\\norganization and the site organization.  ExGen implements a fleet-wide quality assurance \\nprogram, along with procurement and warehouse procedures for all its associated nuclear \\nEnclosure 2 2 \\n   stations to verify, store, and move components\\n between stations using BSC personnel.  Once \\naccepted within the ExGen Quality Management System, a component can be installed at the \\nsite of receipt, or moved and installed at another facility. \\n\\n \\nOn December 11, 2008, ExGen received, inspected, and accepted a HPCI oil pressure \\ncontrol valve, stock code 11466532.  On July 1, 2010, ExGen was notified of a defective part \\nwhen General Electric-Hitachi issued MFN 10-192 (ML101820160), ﬁPart 21 Reportable \\nCondition Notification: Failure of HPCI Turbine Overspeed Reset Control Valve \\nDiaphragm.ﬂ  The Part 21 identified a vulnerab\\nility associated with the HPCI system oil PCV \\nactuator diaphragm due to a manufacturing error.  This error resulted in inadequate fabric \\n\\nreinforcement that is critical to ensure durability and reliability of the diaphragm, preventing \\n\\ntearing of the diaphragm when used in the HPCI turbine lube oil system turbine trip and reset \\nvalves (PCVs).  The failure of the HPCI system PCV™s diaphragm results in a loss of HPCI \\nsystem turbine lubricating and control oil through the failed diaphragm.  According to the \\nPart 21 notification, ﬁdepending on the amount of oil lost and the system demands, this loss \\ncould ultimately result in a failure of the HPCI system.ﬂ  ExGen engineering staff entered \\nissue report (IR) 1086768 into their corrective action program and assigned actions including \\n\\ndirection to BSC staff to address the Part 21.  \\n Exelon procedure SM-AA-102, ﬁWarehouse Operations,ﬂ Revision 14, Attachment 3, \\n\\nSection 1.5.2 required, ﬁItems found to be of suspect quality or deficient (e.g., items identified \\n\\nexternally via 10 CFR Part 21 defect reporting or items identified internally by maintenance) \\nshall be: \\n \\n1.    Placed on ‚Hold™ status electronically to prevent allocation and inadvertent issue.  In  \\n       Passport this may require the item to be issued from stock, then returned, moved from  \\n      [pending] to [hold] status.  \\n 2.    Physically segregated from acceptable items with the same Catalog ID/Stock Code.ﬂ  \\n \\nBSC staff working for ExGen at Limerick identified a PCV subject to the Part 21 notification at \\nthe Limerick facility, but did not segregate or place an electronic ‚hold™ on the PCV in their \\ncomponent tracking database to prevent PCV installation with the defective diaphragm as \\nrequired by internal procedures following the July 1, 2010, Part 21 notification.  BSC staff \\ndocumented the nonconformance in the component tracking database which referenced \\nIR 1086768.  However, procedure SM-AA-102 did not include a standard method to \\ndocument Part 21 deficiencies within the component tracking database.  Instead, there were \\n\\nseveral options for documenting a Part 21 notification within this system, and ExGen relied on \\nskill of the craft for determining how to implement the procedural requirement. \\n On November 19, 2010, SM-AA-102 was revised to require, ﬁconspicuous signage that \\n\\nshows these items are on hold,ﬂ in addition to the electronic hold and physical separation.  \\nHowever, BSC staff at Limerick did not use conspicuous signage on the PCV. \\n On December 16, 2017, ExGen issued purchase order (P.O.) 637326 to move the HPCI \\nsystem PCV from the Limerick warehouse to FitzPatrick during a planned HPCI system \\nmaintenance window.  During a HPCI maintenance window in December 2017, ExGen \\nreplaced the HPCI PCV diaphragm and spring as part of preventive maintenance.  Following \\n\\nmaintenance, ExGen was unsuccessful at restoring HPCI due to inadequate pressures in the \\noil system.  ExGen did not have a replacement PCV on site at the time, and subsequently \\nlocated the subject PCV at Limerick. \\nEnclosure 2 3 \\n   To effect the movement of the part, BSC staff at Limerick and FitzPatrick followed the \\nprocess prescribed in the ExGen Quality Assurance Program Manual (QAPM), \\nRevision 0.  QAPM Section A, ﬁManagement,ﬂ stated, ﬁthe requirements and commitments \\ncontained in the QAPM are mandatory and must be implemented, enforced, and adhered to \\n\\nby all individuals and organizations.ﬂ  QAPM, Section 5, ﬁProcurement Verification,ﬂ required \\nthat, ﬁa program is established and implemented to verify the quality of purchased items and \\nservices at intervals and to a depth consistent with the item's or service's importance to \\n\\nsafety, complexity, and quantity and the freq\\nuency of procurement.ﬂ  QAPM, Section 6, \\nﬁIdentification and Control of Items,ﬂ required a program to be established and implemented \\nto identify and control items to prevent the use of incorrect or defective items.   \\n\\n \\nThe inspectors determined that, in spite of utilizing the above process, staff involved with \\ntransferring the HPCI PCV and inspecting and accepting it at FitzPatrick did not identify the \\nnonconformance, even though the information was readily available in both the ExGen \\n\\ncomponent tracking database and corrective action database.  The defective valve was \\naccepted using a Product Quality Certificate dated December 12, 2008.  This Product Quality \\nCertificate was invalidated by the July 1, 2010 Part 21 notification.  The PCV was \\n\\nsubsequently installed in the FitzPatrick HPCI system during the maintenance window on \\nDecember 16, 2017.   \\n \\nStaff involved with transferring the HPCI PCV and inspecting and accepting it at FitzPatrick \\nreasonably had access to information about the nonconformance through at least two \\nmeans.  First, to receive the part at FitzPatrick, BSC staff at FitzPatrick accessed the \\ncomponent tracking database and removed a 'hold' due to a shelf life concern.  The \\n\\ninspectors reviewed the component tracking database and identified that information on \\nIR 1086768, the IR associated with the 10 CFR Part 21 notification, was present in the \\ndatabase and could reasonably be identified by a qualified procurement engineer when \\n\\nperforming a review of available information to address the ‚hold'.  Second, the Part 21 \\ninformation was available to the staff through the ExGen corrective action program, as \\nIR 1086768 was noted in the component tracking database.  The IR had not been resolved at \\n\\nthe time the part was moved to and accepted at FitzPatrick, and this information would have \\nbeen available to any staff involved with this activity. \\n As a result of the defective part installation, on April 10, 2020, at 1:15 AM, while conducting \\nmonthly technical specification surveillance testing of the HPCI auxiliary oil system, operators \\nidentified an oil leak on pressure control valve (PCV), 23PCV-12.  The auxiliary oil pump was \\nsecured and the HPCI system was still considered operable by ExGen staff.  Operators were \\n\\nnot able to definitively quantify the initial leak.  At 3:00 AM, a second start of the auxiliary oil \\npump was attempted to quantify the leak.  During the second run, operators estimated the \\nleak to be 1.3 gpm.  Thus, the HPCI system was declared inoperable and placed the station \\ninto a higher licensee-established risk category (Yellow).  ExGen notified the NRC of the \\ninoperability per 10 CFR Part 50.72(b)(3)(v)(D) via Event Notification 54647.  The 23PCV-12 \\nvalve was replaced and the HPCI system restored to operable status on April 10, 2020, \\nat 8:02 PM. \\n  Corrective Actions:  ExGen performed immediate corrective actions to replace the defective \\nHPCI system PCV.  ExGen also performed a fleet-wide stand down for procurement staff \\n\\nto conduct additional training.  Additionally, ExGen created a separate action for each ExGen \\nsite to validate that a similar condition does not exist regarding dispositioning Part 21 \\ncomponents with inaccurate codes in their parts tracking database.  Furthermore, ExGen \\nEnclosure 2 4 \\n   revised its warehouse and procurement procedures, adding steps pertaining to items subject \\nto 10 CFR Part 21 notifications and items with holds. \\n  \\nCorrective Action References:  IR 4334315, IR 4348906 \\nPerformance Assessment: \\n  Performance Deficiency:  The inspectors determined that ExGen failed to ensure that \\n\\npurchased material conformed to all procurement requirements and to reject a nonconforming \\n\\nitem and prevent its installation and use as required by 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion \\nVII, ﬁControl of Purchased Material, Equipment, and Services,ﬂ and Criterion XV, ﬁNon-\\nconforming Materials, Parts, and Components,ﬂ which was within their ability to foresee and \\n\\nprevent.  \\n ExGen implemented the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B using the Quality \\n\\nAssurance Program Manual (QAPM), Revision 0 in 2017.  Section A, ﬁManagement,ﬂ stated, \\nﬁthe requirements and commitments contained in the QAPM are mandatory and must be \\nimplemented, enforced, and adhered to by all individuals and organizations.ﬂ  Section 5, \\nﬁProcurement Verification,ﬂ required a program to be established and implemented to verify \\n\\nthe quality of purchased items and services.  Section 6, ﬁIdentification and Control of Items,ﬂ \\nrequired a program to be established and implemented to identify and control items to \\nprevent the use of incorrect or defective items.  Procedure SM-AA-102 implemented these \\n\\nprocurement verification requirements.  \\n On December 16, 2017, ExGen failed to verify that the PCV conformed to procurement \\n\\ndocuments and did not identify that the PCV was nonconforming.  Consequently, the PCV \\ncontaining the defective diaphragm was not rejected and was, instead, accepted using a \\nProduct Quality Certificate dated December 9, 2008, which was subsequently invalidated by \\nthe Part 21 notification issued July 1, 2010.  The PCV was installed at FitzPatrick on \\n\\nDecember 16, 2017 and failed on April 10, 2020. \\n  Screening:  The inspectors determined the performance deficiency was more than minor \\n\\nbecause it was associated with the Equipment Performance attribute of the Mitigating \\nSystems cornerstone and adversely affected the cornerstone objective to ensure the \\navailability, reliability, and capability of systems that respond to initiating events to prevent \\n\\nundesirable consequences.  Specifically, the HPCI system was unavailable to perform its \\nsafety function as a result of the failed PCV. \\n  Significance:  The inspectors assessed the significance of the finding using Appendix A, ﬁThe \\n\\nSignificance Determination Process (SDP) for Findings At-Power.ﬂ  The inspectors reviewed \\nInspection Manual Chapter (IMC) 0609, Attachment 4, ﬁInitial Characterization of Findings,ﬂ \\nand determined the finding affects the mitigating system cornerstone.  The inspectors \\n\\nevaluated the significance of this finding using Inspection Manual Chapter (IMC) 0609,  \\nAppendix A, ﬁThe Significance Determination Process (SDP) for Findings at Power,ﬂ Exhibit 2 \\nŒ Mitigating Systems Screening Questions.  The inspectors determined that the finding \\nrepresented a loss of the PRA function of a single train, the HPCI system, for greater than its \\n\\ntechnical specification (TS) allowed outage time and required a detailed risk evaluation \\n(DRE). \\n A Region I Senior Reactor Analyst (SRA) performed a detailed risk evaluation.  The finding \\nwas determined to be of low to moderate safety significance (White).  The risk important core \\ndamage sequences were dominated by internal events, primarily loss of condenser heat sink \\nEnclosure 2 5 \\n   and loss of main feedwater.  The dominant core damage sequence is loss of condenser heat \\nsink, failure of high-pressure injection (HPI), and failure to manually depressurize the \\nreactor.  See Enclosure 1 to this final determination report and the Attachment, ﬁHPCI Oil \\nPCV Failure Detailed Risk Evaluation,ﬂ to the preliminary determination report (ADAMS \\nAccession Number: ML21020A108) for a detailed review of the quantitative and qualitative \\ncriteria considered in the final risk determination. \\n Cross-Cutting Aspect:  H.1 - Resources: Leaders ensure that personnel, equipment, \\nprocedures, and other resources are available and adequate to support nuclear safety.  The \\ncause of the finding was determined to be associated with a cross-cutting aspect \\n\\nof Resources in the Human Performance area because ExGen staff failed to identify and \\naddress a nonconformance during verification of the quality of the HPCI system \\nPCV.  Specifically, the inspectors determined there were multiple ways for ExGen to \\nreasonably identify a nonconformance associated with the PCV diaphragm which had not \\n\\nbeen addressed.  Furthermore, procurement implementing procedures did not provide \\nadequate guidance to ensure that procedure users would identify and resolve this issue.  \\nHaving comprehensive steps within the relevant procedure would likely have prevented \\ninstallation of the defective part at FitzPatrick. \\n   ENCLOSURE 3 \\n NOTICE OF VIOLATION \\n Exelon Generation Company, LLC     Docket No.  50-333 \\nJames A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant    License No. DPR-59 \\n                 EA-20-138 \\n                    \\nDuring an NRC inspection conducted from April 10, 2020, through December 14, 2020, and for \\nwhich an inspection exit meeting was conducted on December 14, 2020, violations of NRC \\n\\nrequirements were identified.  In accordance with the \\nNRC Enforcement Policy, the violations \\nare listed below:  \\n A. Title 10 of the \\nCode of Federal Regulations\\n (10 CFR) Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion VII, \\nﬁControl of Purchased Material, Equipment, and Services,ﬂ requires, in part, that \\nmeasures shall be established to assure that purchased material, equipment, and \\nservices, whether purchased directly or through contractors and subcontractors conform \\n\\nto procurement documents. Documentary evidence that material and equipment conform \\nto the procurement requirements shall be available at the nuclear power plant or fuel \\nprocessing plant site and shall be sufficient to identify the specific requirements, such as \\n\\ncodes, standards, or specifications, met by the purchased material or equipment.  \\n Contrary to the above, on December 16, 2017, the licensee did not ensure measures \\n\\nwere established to assure that purchased material, equipment and services conform to \\n\\nprocurement documents.  Specifically, the licensee did not ensure that a replacement \\nhigh pressure coolant injection (HPCI) system oil pressure control valve (PCV) \\nconformed to procurement documents.  As a result, on December 16, 2017, the licensee \\n\\naccepted and installed for use a PCV at the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant \\n(FitzPatrick) that had a known nonconforming material defect (i.e., defective diaphragm) \\nthat was first identified in a 10 CFR Part 21 report on July 3, 2010.  \\n B. Title 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, Criterion XV, ﬁNonconforming Materials, Parts, or \\nComponents,ﬂ requires that measures shall be established to control materials, parts, or \\ncomponents which do not conform to requirements in order to prevent their inadvertent \\n\\nuse or installation.  Nonconforming items shall be reviewed and accepted, rejected, \\nrepaired, or reworked in accordance with documented procedures. \\n \\nFitzPatrick Technical Specification (TS 3.5.1), in part, requires the HPCI system to be \\noperable in Modes 1, 2, and 3 with reactor steam dome pressure >150 psig.  If the HPCI \\nsystem is determined to be inoperable, it shall be returned to an operable status within \\n\\n14 days.  If not restored to an operable status, the unit shall be shut down and in Mode 3 \\n\\nwithin 12 hours.  \\n Contrary to the above, from December 16, 2017, to April 10, 2020, the licensee did not \\n\\nensure that measures were established to control materials, parts, or components which \\ndo not conform to requirements in order to prevent their inadvertent use or installation \\nand did not ensure that nonconforming items shall be reviewed and accepted, rejected, \\n\\nrepaired, or reworked in accordance with documented procedures.  Specifically, staff \\ninvolved with the sale, inspection, and installation of the HPCI PCV to FitzPatrick failed \\nto ensure the PCV conformed to all procurement requirements and failed to reject the \\n\\nnonconforming item.  As a result, the valve was accepted and installed for use at \\nEnclosure 3 2 \\n   FitzPatrick.  On April 10, 2020, the HPCI system was declared inoperable during a \\nmonthly surveillance test as a result of a leak and system oil loss from the \\nnonconforming HPCI PCV that would have prevented the system from performing its \\n\\nsafety function.  Consequently, the HPCI system was rendered inoperable prior to  \\n\\nApril 10, 2020, for a period longer than its TS allowed outage time, and the unit was not \\nshut down and placed in Mode 3 within 12 hours in accordance with NRC reportability \\nguidelines.\\n   These violations are categorized collectively as a problem and are associated with a White \\nSignificance Determination Process finding. \\n Pursuant to the provisions of 10 CFR 2.201, Exelon Generation Company, LLC (the licensee) is \\nhereby required to submit a written statement or explanation to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory \\n\\nCommission, ATTN:  Document Control Desk, Washington, DC 20555-0001 with a copy to the \\nRegional Administrator, Region I, and a copy to the NRC Resident Inspector at the facility that is \\nthe subject of this Notice, within 30 days of the date of the letter transmitting this Notice of \\nViolation (Notice).

Licensee investigation revealed \\nthe cause of the failure was an out\\n-of-specification plunger received from the vendor.\\n  The failed actuator for the \\nADS valve\\n had been originally installed in March\\n 2018 and t\\nhe licensee \\ndetermined that \\nthe ADS valve \\nwas \\ninoperable for the entire \\nfuel \\ncycle.\\n This accident sequence precursor (ASP) analysis reveals that the most likely core damage \\nsequences involve internal event \\nscenarios that result in \\na loss of \\nservice \\nwater transient with \\nfailure of SRVs to close and failure of \\nall \\nhigh\\n-pressure injection\\n sources\\n [reactor core isolation \\ncooling (RCIC) and high\\n-pressure coolant injection \\n(HPCI)]\\n.  This accident sequence account\\ns for approximately 5\\n5 percent of the increase in \\nthe \\n\\nevent.  The \\nmean\\n \\n3×10-5, which is dominated\\n from internal event\\n scenarios (\\n\\n).  The risk from internal floods, \\nseismic \\nevents\\n, high winds, \\nand tornados, \\ncontributes \\nless \\nthan 3 percent\\n to the total \\n for this \\nevent\\n.

No licen\\nsee \\nperformance deficiency\\n (PD)\\n associated with this event\\n was\\n identified and,\\n therefore, an ASP analysis was performed since a Significance Determination Process (SDP)\\n evaluation was not performed\\n. 2 EVENT \\nDETAILS \\n  2.1 Event Description\\n On March 30, 2020, with Unit 2 in shutdown for a refueling outage, \\nelectromatic \\nrelief \\nvalve \\n2-0203-3D \\nof the ADS \\nfailed to actuate\\n during performance of \\na TS surveillance \\ntest.\\n  All other \\nUnit 2 \\nADS valves were successfully\\n cycled open and closed\\n.  A Lice\\nnsee investigation \\nrevealed \\nthe cause of the failure was an out\\n-of-specification plunger received from the vendor.\\n  LER 2\\n65-2020-002  2 The failed actuator for the \\nADS valve\\n had been originally installed in March\\n 2018 and t\\nhe licensee determined that the ADS valve was \\ninoperable for the entire \\nfuel \\ncycle.\\n The failed ADS valve \\nactuator was dissembled and inspected to determine the cause of the \\nfailure. \\n The plunger width was found to be different from the top to mid\\n-length indic\\nating the \\nlegs \\nwere\\n splay\\ned and this plunger width was outside the manufacturer's tolerance. \\n The plunger width was not a\\n parameter that was measured during vendor dedication until 2019, after \\nthe rebuild of the\\n actuator in 2018.\\n  Additional information\\n is provided in\\n licensee event report \\n(LER) 269-2020\\n-002, \"Electromatic\\n Relief Valve 3D Did Not Actuate Due to Out of Specification \\nPlunger\\n,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No\\n.

NRC inspectors\\n determined\\n that the failure\\n was not reasonably foreseeable and preventable by the licensee \\nand, therefore\\n, is not a performance deficiency.  \\nThe LER was \\nreviewed and closed \\nin\\n inspection report \\n 05000265/2020002, ﬁIntegrated Inspection Report 05000254/2020002 and \\n05000265/2020002,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML20225A008\\n).  An independent ASP analysis \\nwas performed because no\\n licensee PD\\n was \\nidentified and the potential \\nfor \\nrisk significance of \\nthis event.\\n Additional LE\\nRs were reviewed to determine if unavailabilities existed \\nconcurrently with \\nthe ADS\\n valve\\n failure\\n.  One \\nwindowed event \\nof a concurrent degraded condition w\\nas identified.\\n  LER\\n 265-20-001, \"Loss of Both Divisions of Residual Heat Removal Low Pressure Coolant \\nInjection Due to Swing Bus Failure to Transfer,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML20140A093), \\nreported \\na motor \\ncontrol \\ncenter (MCC) failed to transfer between buses during the performance \\n of testing\\n.  This resulted in \\nthe licensee \\ndeclaring both loops of \\nlow-pressure \\ncoolant \\ninjection \\n(LPCI) inoperable\\n.  The failure \\nof the \\nauto-transfer would \\nprevent\\n the LPCI \\ninject\\nion valves \\nfrom \\nopening.\\n  The apparent cause of the event was a manufacturing error in the LPCI swing bus \\ntime delay relay.  Prior to installation of the relay in 2018, bench testing and calibration were \\nsuccessfully \\nperformed\\n.  An analysis assuming the fa\\niled MCC auto\\n-transfer and ADS valve for \\na maximum of 1 year show\\ns that the MCC auto\\n-transfer \\nhas a negligible\\n impact \\non the risk of \\nADS valve failure and, therefore, is not further considered in this \\nASP analysis\\n. 3.2 Exposure \\nTime\\n The Licensee reported that the ADS valve was found to be inoperable for the entire operating \\ncycle.  Therefore, the exposure time was set to the maximum of one year in accordance with \\nof \\nVolum\\ne 1 of the RASP Handbook\\n, \"Risk Assessment of Operational Events (RASP) Handbook\\n,\" Revision 2.02, \\n(ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML17348A149\\n). 3.3 Analysis Type\\n A condition \\nanalysis was performed using \\nRevision\\n 8.59 of the \\nstandardized plant analysis risk \\n(SPAR) model f\\nor \\nQuad Cities Nuclear\\n Power Station \\n(Unit\\n 1) Test and Limited Use \\nModel LER 2\\n65-2020-002  3 (TLU)\\n0F\\n1, revision dated September 24, 2020\\n.

This \\nSPAR model includes the following hazards:\\n \\n\\n \\nInternal events,\\n \\n\\n \\nInternal f\\nloods,\\n \\n\\n \\nSeismic,\\n \\n\\n \\nHigh winds, and\\n \\n\\n \\nTornados.\\n \\n3.3\\n \\nSPAR\\n \\nModel Modifications\\n \\nThe following \\nmodification was made to the SPAR model for this analysis:\\n \\n\\n \\nCrediting FLEX Strategies\\n.  The probability of basic event FLX\\n-\\nXHE\\n-\\nXE\\n-\\nELAP \\n(\\noperators fail to declare ELAP when bene\\nficial\\n) was set to its nominal value of 10\\n-\\n2\\n \\nto \\nactivate the credit for FLEX mitigation strategies for postulated SBO scenarios for which \\nan extended loss of AC power (ELAP) is declared.\\n \\nLER 338\\n-\\n2020\\n-\\n001\\n \\n \\n3\\n \\n\\n \\nFLEX Reliability Parameters\\n.  FLEX hardware reliability parameters su\\nitable for inclusion \\nin the NRC SPAR models is not yet available.  Therefore, the base SPAR models \\ncurrently use the reliability parameters of permanently installed equipment, which is \\ninconsistent with the limited experience with the operation of FLEX equ\\nipment.  As part \\nof an NRC audit performed of preliminary FLEX hardware data provided by the \\n\\nreviewed the FLEX hardware parameters estimated by the PWROG.  This review \\nrevealed that\\n \\nFLEX diesel generator failure\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nstart (FTS) probability is 3 to 10\\n \\ntimes \\nhigher and failure\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nrun (FTR) rate is 2 to 5\\n \\ntimes higher than permanently installed \\nEDGs.  The portable engine\\n-\\ndriven centrifugal pump FTS probability is at least 8\\n \\ntimes \\nhigher \\nand FTR rate is at least 6\\n \\ntimes higher than permanently installed pumps.  See \\nTable\\n \\n1 in \\nINL/EXT\\n-\\n20\\n-\\n58327\\n\\n(ADAMS Accession No.\\n \\nML20155K834) for additional information.  Therefore, to provide \\na more representative estimate of the FLEX hardware reliability parameters, this \\nanalysis increased the hardware reliability by a factor of three in the best estimate case.\\n \\n\\n \\nRemoval of EDG Repa\\nir Credit for ELAP Scenarios\\n.  The base SPAR model provides \\ncredit for repair of postulated EDG \\nfailures for SBO scenarios.  However, this potential \\ncredit is not applicable for scenarios where ELAP will be declared because (a.) operators \\nwill be focused o\\nn implementing the FLEX mitigation strategies and (b.) the DC load \\nshedding activities could preclude recovery of EDGs.  Therefore, credit for EDG repair \\ncredit was removed from the sequences if it is included after ELAP is likely declared \\n(i.e.,\\n \\n1\\n \\nhour)\\n.\\n \\n\\n \\n72\\n-\\nHour AC Power Recovery Requirement\\n.  The base SPAR model requires AC power \\nrecovery within 72\\n \\nhours \\nfor a safe/stable end state for ELAP scenarios with successful \\nFLEX implementation.  If AC power is not recovered in these scenarios, the SPAR \\nmodels ass\\nume core damage.  The American Society of Mechanical \\nEngineers/American Nuclear Society probabilistic risk assessment standard definition for \\nsafe/stable end state does not require AC power recovery.  Because of the large \\nuncertainty in modeling assumption\\ns related to availability and reliability of components \\nand strategies for mission times that are well beyond 24 hours and the unclear basis for \\nrequiring AC power recovery within 72\\n \\nhours, the 72\\n-\\nhour AC power requirement was \\neliminated in this analysis\\n. \\n \\nAs part of this change, the FTR events for FLEX diesel \\ngenerators and pumps have a 72\\n-\\nhour mission time in the base SPAR model.  These \\nmission times were reset to be consistent with the 24\\n-\\nhour mission time used in the \\nSPAR model.\\n \\n3.4\\n \\nExposure Time\\n \\nTh\\ne follow\\ning two exposure times were identified for this condition a\\nnalysis\\n:\\n \\n\\n \\nExposure \\nTime 1\\n.\\n  \\nThe licensee concluded that the EDG \\n\\ndegradation occurred \\nduring \\nits start as part of \\nsurveillance testing completed on January 22, 2020\\n.\\n \\n \\nRepairs \\nwere \\ncompleted on February\\n \\n26\\nth\\n \\nafter successful post\\n-\\nmaintenance testing.  \\nTherefore, \\n\\n36\\n \\ndays.  \\nHowever, the failure mechanism could have occurred during any start of the EDG after \\nits\\n \\nsuccessful\\n \\nsurveillance test completed on December 16, 2019\\n, which is\\n \\nan additional \\n37\\n \\ndays.\\n \\nTherefore, \\n\\nfor \\napproximately \\n73\\n \\ndays\\n.  \\nE\\nxposure time \\n1 \\nis \\ncalculated as 1712 hours (i.e., \\n73 days \\nminus the 40 hours\\n \\nfrom exposure time 2\\n)\\n.\\n \\nLER 338\\n-\\n2020\\n-\\n001\\n \\n \\n4\\n \\n\\n \\nExposure Time 2\\n.\\n  \\nBased on the information provided in \\nLER 338\\n-\\n20\\n-\\n001\\n,\\n \\nEDG \\n\\nwas \\ninoperable for normal maintenance and surveillance activities for approximately \\n40\\n \\nhours \\nbetween December 16, 2019 through February 26, 2020\\n.

On March 9, 2019, \\nthe Unit\\n 3 reactor \\nautomatic\\nally scrammed due to \\na turbine \\nload reject. \\n The automatic \\nscram was cause\\nd when a l\\nicensed \\nreactor \\noperator

The operator\\n incorrectly \\nmanipulated \\na hand switch \\nby \\nchang\\ning \\nthe\\n automatic \\nvoltage regulator from auto\\nmatic\\n to manual. \\n In this mode of operation, \\nthe dynamic limiter is\\n removed, which allows \\noperators \\nto adjust \\nmega-volt \\namps \\nreactive \\nbeyond the \\nunder-excitation \\nlimiter protection setting. \\n As a result, the \\nmain \\ngenerator circui\\nt breaker tripped causing a \\nturbine\\n load reject and \\nsubsequent\\n automatic\\n scram\\n.

In addition, high\\n-pressure coolant injection (\\nHPCI\\n) and reactor core isolation cooling (\\nRCIC\\n) initiated on low reactor\\n water level\\n and successfully provided inventory makeup to the reactor\\n.  The licensee declared a notice of unusual event (\\nNOUE) due to loss of the 500\\n-kV offsite power \\nsource.\\n  This accident sequence precursor (ASP) analysis reveals that the most likely core damage \\nscenario is a \\nloss of offsite power (\\nLOOP\\n) initiating event \\nand the successful \\noperation of the \\nEDGs provid\\ning safety\\n-related alternating current (AC)\\n power\\n with subsequent (postulated) \\nstuck\\n-open safety relief valves (SRVs) result\\ning\\n in a loss\\n-of-coolant ac\\ncident (LOCA) and \\nthe (postulated) failure of \\nlow pressure injection resulting in core damage\\n.  This accident sequence \\naccount\\ns for approximately 37\\n percent of the \\ntotal \\nconditional core damage probability (C\\nCDP)\\n for this event.\\n  Although the CCDP of this event exceeds the ASP threshold, the risk was mitigated by the plant \\nhaving \\nfour EDGs\\n and the availability of an electric\\n-driven high\\n-pressure makeup\\n-up pump the \\nlicensee installed as part their effort to meet the requirements of \\nNational Fire Protection\\n Association (NFPA) 805, ﬁ\\nPerformance\\n-Based Standard for Fire Protection for Light Water \\nReactor Electric Generating Plants\\n.ﬂ LER \\n296-2019-001-01   2 EVENT DETAILS \\n            Event Description\\n.  On March 9, 2019, \\nthe Unit\\n 3 automatic\\nally scrammed due to \\na turbine \\nload reject. \\n The automatic \\nscram was cause\\nd when a l\\nicensed \\nreactor \\noperator lower\\ned incoming reactive power\\n at the request of grid operators\\n.  The \\noperator\\n incorrectly \\nmanipulated \\na hand switch \\nby \\nchang\\ning \\nthe automatic voltage regulator from \\nautomatic\\n to manual. \\n In this \\nmode of operation, the dynamic limiter is\\n removed, which allows \\noperators \\nto adjust \\nmega volt \\namps \\nreactive beyond the \\nunder-excitation \\nlimiter protection setting. \\n As a result, the \\nmain \\ngenerator circuit breaker tripped causi\\nng a turbine\\n load reject and \\nsubsequent\\n automatic\\n scram\\n.  All safety systems actuated as designed.\\n  Specifically, all\\n four Unit\\n 3 EDGs \\nstarted and loaded \\nonto their respective 4\\n-kV \\nshutdown \\nboards \\n(per design)\\n.  In addition, \\nHPCI and RCIC initiated \\non low \\nreactor\\n water level\\n and successfully provided inventory makeup to the reactor\\n.  The licensee declared an \\nNOUE due to \\nloss of the 500\\n-kV offsite power source.  \\nAdditional \\ninformation is provided in \\nlicensee event report (LER)\\n 296-2019-001-01 (Ref.\\n 1). Cause.\\n  This event was \\ndirect\\nly cause\\nd by a reactor operator \\nincorrectly\\n manipulating \\na hand switch \\nby \\nchang\\ning\\n the voltage regulator from auto\\nmatic\\n to manual.\\n  The licensee determined \\nthat root cause of this event was the operations department \\nallow\\ning\\n continued negative human \\nperformance behaviors by inconsistently\\n providing \\nreinforcement\\n on the use of appropriate \\nhuman performance\\n barriers\\n. MODELING \\n             SDP Results/\\nBasis for ASP Analysis\\n.  The ASP Program performs independent analyses for \\ninitiating events.  ASP analyses of initiating events account for all failures/degraded conditions \\nand unavailabilities (e.g.,\\n equipment out for test/maintenance) th\\nat occurred during the event, \\nregardless of licensee performance.\\n1  Additional LERs were reviewed to determine if concurrent \\nunavailabilities existed during the \\nMarch\\n 9th event\\n.  No windowed events or concurrent \\ndegraded operating conditions were \\nidentified\\n.  Discussions with Region 2 staff indicate that a \\npreliminary \\nlicensee performance deficiency \\nassociated with this event \\nhas been identified; \\nhowever, the \\nevaluation has not completed and the \\nLER remains open.\\n Analysis Type.\\n  An initiating event\\n analysis was performed \\nusing the \\nRevision\\n 8.62 standardized plant analysis risk (\\nSPAR\\n) model\\n for \\nBrowns Ferry\\n Nuclear Plant (Unit\\n 3) create\\nd in \\nJune\\n 2019.  This event was modeled as a \\nswitchyard\\n-centered LOOP initiating event\\n. Key Modeling Assumptions\\n.  The following modeling assumptions were determined to be \\nsignificant to the modeling of this initiating event assessment:\\n  The probability of IE\\n-LOOPSC\\n (loss of \\noffsite power (switchyard\\n-centered\\n)) was set to \\n1.0 due to the \\nloss of offsite power caused by\\n the turbine load reject\\n.  All other initiating \\nevent probabilities were set to zero.\\n  The probability of b\\nasic event FLX\\n-XHE\\n-XM-ELAP\\n was set to \\na screening value of 0.1\\n to activate the credit for FLEX mitigation strategies for \\npostulated \\nstation blackout \\n(SBO) \\n                                                 1  ASP analyses also account for any degraded condition(s) identified after the initiating event occurred, if the \\nfailure/degradation exposure period(s) overlapped the initiating event date.\\n LER \\n296-2019-001-01   3 scenarios\\n for which an extended loss of \\nAC power (ELAP) is declared.\\n2  Sensitivity \\nanalyses show that any further refinement of these human error probabilities\\n (HEPs)\\n has \\na negligible\\n impact on the results of this analysis.\\n  Offsite Power Recovery\\n.  Offsite power was restored \\nfrom 500\\n-kV offsite power source \\nto the 4-kV \\nshutdown \\nboards\\n approximately 14 hours after the LOOP \\ninitiated.  \\nHowever, \\nthe alternate 161\\n-kV offsite power source remained available throughout the event.  \\nAlthough this alternate o\\nffsite power source was supplying Unit\\n 2 during \\nan outage, it is \\nestimated that \\noperators could have aligned this source to at least one of the Unit\\n 3 4-kV \\nshutdown boards within an hour.\\n Œ Basic event OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR30MSC (\\noperators \\nfail to \\nrecover \\noffsite \\npower in \\n30 minutes\\n) was set to TRUE given the uncertainties associated with operators being \\nable to align the 161\\n-kV offsite power source to a Unit 3 4\\n-kV shutdown\\n board within \\n30 minutes.  Although this assumption is potential conservative, sensitivity an\\nalyses \\nshow this assumption has a negligible effect on the analysis results.\\n Œ Basic events \\nOEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR01HSC (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in \\n1 hour), OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR02HSC (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in \\n2 hours\\n), OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR04HSC (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in \\n4 hours\\n), OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR10HSC (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in \\n10 hours\\n), and OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR12HSC (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in \\n12 hours\\n) were \\nevaluated using the \\nSPAR-H Human Reliability An\\nalysis Method (\\nRef.\\n 2 and Ref\\n 3).  The HEPs were calculated to be 4×10\\n-2 for \\nOEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR01HSC\\n and \\n10-3 for \\nOEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR02HSC\\n, OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR04HSC, OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR10HSC\\n, and OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR12HSC\\n.  See \\nAppendix B\\n for additional information on \\nthis \\nevaluation\\n. ANALYSIS RESULTS \\n           CCDP.  The conditional CCDP for this analysis is calculated to be \\n3.2×10-6.  The ASP Program \\nacceptance threshold is a CCDP of 1×10\\n-6 or the CCDP equivalent of an uncomplicated reactor \\ntrip with a non\\n-recoverable loss of feed water or the condenser heat sink), whichever is greater.  \\nThis CCDP equivalent for \\nBrowns Ferry Nuc\\nlear Plant\\n (Unit\\n 3) is \\n2.7×10-6.3  Therefore, this \\nevent is a \\nprecursor\\n.

Key Cue(s)\\n  Momentary loss of all AC power (for all scenarios)\\n  EDGs successfully start and load onto respective 4\\n-kV shutdown boards \\n(LO\\nOP with no SBO scenarios)\\n  EDG failure annunciators (SBO scenarios only)\\n Procedural\\n Guidance\\n AOI\\n-57-1B, ﬁLoss of 500 kVﬂ\\n Diagnosis/Action\\n This HFE only contains both diagnosis and action activities.\\n  PSF Multiplier\\n Diagnosis\\n/Action\\n Notes\\n Time\\n Available\\n 1 or \\n0.01\\n / 1 The operators would need approximately 15 minutes to \\nperform the action component of\\n restor\\ning 161\\n-kV offsite \\npower to a 4\\n-kV shutdown board.\\n  \\nTherefore, the minimum \\ntime for diagnosis is approximately \\n45 minutes\\n for the most \\nlimiting HFE\\n.  \\nThere \\nis \\nuncertainty associated with how \\nmuch time it will take operators to get through procedures \\nand determine the limit\\nations\\n of the 161\\n-kV offsite power \\nsource given it was supplying Unit\\n 2 during its outage.  \\nTherefore, available time for the diagn\\nosis component for \\nthe 1\\n-hour\\n recovery is assigned as \\nNominal Time\\n (i.e., ×1).  \\nAvailable time for the diagnosis component for recoveries \\nwith at least \\n2 hours is assigned as \\nExpansive Time\\n (i.e., \\n×0.01; time available is >2 times nominal and >30 \\nminutes).\\n  Sufficient\\n time\\n exists\\n to\\n perform\\n the\\n action\\n component\\n of the\\n offsite\\n power\\n recovery;\\n therefore,\\n the\\n action\\n PSF for\\n available\\n time\\n is\\n set\\n to\\n Nominal\\n (i.e., ×1).\\n  See\\n Ref\\n 3 for\\n guidance\\n on apportioning\\n time\\n between\\n the\\n diagnosis\\n and action\\n components\\n of an HFE.\\n Stress\\n 2 / 2\\n The PSF for diagnosis and action stress \\nwa\\ns set to\\n High\\n (i.e.,\\n ×2) \\nbecause the \\nmost severe \\nscenario involves \\na postulated SBO where recovery of offsite power is \\nrequired\\n to prevent core damage.\\n LER \\n296-2019-001-01   B-2 PSF Multiplier\\n Diagnosis\\n/Action\\n Notes\\n Complexity\\n 2 / 1\\n The PSF for diagnosis complexity \\nwas\\n assigned a value of \\nModerately Complex\\n (i.e., ×2) because operators would \\nhave to contend with multiple equipment unavailabilities \\nand concurrent acti\\nons/multiple procedures du\\nring \\nall \\npostulated\\n scenario\\ns.  \\nThe PSF for action complexity was \\nnot determined to be a performance driver for these HFEs \\nand, therefore, was \\nset to \\nNominal\\n (i.e.,\\n ×1).\\n Procedures,\\n Experience/Training,\\n Ergonomics/HMI,\\n Fitness for Duty,\\n Work Processes\\n 1 /\\n 1 No event information is available to warrant a change in \\nthese PSFs (diagnosis or action) from \\nNominal\\n (i.e., ×\\n1).  The HEP is calculated using the following SPAR\\n-H formula:\\n HEP = (Product of Diagnosis PSFs × Nominal Diagnosis HEP) + (Product of Action\\n PSFs × \\nNominal Action HEP)\\n  Therefore, the \\nHEP for \\nOEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR01HSC\\n was \\ncalculated as 4\\n×10-2.

As Reactor Coolant System (RCS) pressure reached 2235 psig, one of two Pressurizer Spray Valves began to dose as expected and the other valve traveled unexpectedly to the fully open position. The operators were unable to close the failed open valve.and manually tripped the reactor at 22:42 due to lowering RCS pressure. RCS pressure continued to lower below the safety injection (SI) actuation setpoint and an automatic SI occurred. All safety systems responded as expected and RCS pressure recovered to normal. The cause of the failed open valve was due to foreign material from the control air supply lodged in the positioner spool valve. The valve positioner and electro-pneumatic transmitter were replaced which returned the valve back into service. Planned corrective actions indude installing point of use filtration upstream of susceptible valve positioners or replace associated regulating valves to include a filter. This event was reported via Event Notification 54885 in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(A), 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2Xiv)(B), and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(rv)(A). This event is reportable as a Licensee Event Report in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(lv)(A).

FACLITY NAME Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 2 NARRATIVE EVENT DESCRIPTION 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LERNJIIEER YEAR SEQUeITw.. 05000316 NUMBER 2020 -003 REV NO. -00 On September 4, 2020, Unit 2 was operating at 100 percent power. The Unit 2 control room operators were preparing to perform Main Turbine Stop and Control Valve [T AJM testing. At 16:06, the operators placed the initial set of Pressurizer Backup Heaters [PZR][EHTR] into service in preparation for a planned power reduction to support testing. After the heaters energized, the Pressurizer Spray Valve(s) [AB][FCV] 2-NRV-163 \"Reactor Coolant Loop '#3 to Pressurizer Spray Control Valve\" and 2-NRV-164 \"Reactor Coolant Loop #4 to Pressurizer Spray Control Valve\" were modulating to control pressurizer pressure. At 20:35, the operators began to lower reactor power in accordance with 2-OHP-4021-011-001, Attachment 2, Power Reductions Between 89 percent and 100 percent At 22:04, operators reported completing the planned power reduction and Unit 2 was stable at 92 percent reactor power. At 22:37, Pressurizer Spray Valves 2-NRV-163 and 2-NRV-164 closed together as expected in response to a lowering pressurizer pressure. At 22:38, both Pressurizer Spray Valves began to open upon a valid open signal. At 22:39, Reactor Coolant System (RCS) pressure reached 2235 psig and 2-NRV-163 began to close, as 2-NRV-164 continued to travel fully open. At 22:42, the control room received an annunciator, \"Pressurizer Pressure Low Deviation Backup Heaters On\" and discovered that 2-NRV-164 was fully open with zero percent demand. The operators entered procedure 2-0HP-4022-IFR-001, Instrument FaUure Response and determined that 2-NRV-164 could not be closed using control board or digital controls Alarm Log Panel controls. In accordance with procedure immediate actions, operators performed a manual trip of the Unit 2 Reactor [RCT]. The operators entered procedure 2-0HP-4023-E-O, Reactor Trip or Safety Injection. Reactor Coolant Pump(s) (RCP) [AB][P] 23 and 24 were removed from service following verification of E-0 immediate actions. Safety Injection (SI) automatically actuated after RCS pressure lowered below the setpoinl All automatic actions in response to the SI signal occurred as expected. Following the trip, Unit 2 was supplied by offsite power. AJI control rods fully inserted. The Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps [BA][P] started and operated, as expected. All Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) [BQ] components and Containment Isolation [8D] operated as required. Both Emergency Diesel Generators (EDG) [EK][DG] automatically started and remained in standby. Decay heat was removed by the Condenser Steam Dump Valves [SGJM and ECCS was secured.

NUMBER -003 REV NO. -00 During SI termination, RCP 22 was removed from service due to continued lowering RCS pressure caused by the failed open pressurizer spray valve 2-NRV-164. Afterward, RCS pressure recovered to normal pressure and remained stable. The event was reported via Event Notification 54885 in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(A), 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B), and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ivXA). The event is reportable as a Licensee Event \\nReport (LER) in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), for systems that resulted in a manual or automatic actuation of the R~ctor Protection System (RPS), Containment Isolation, Emergency Core Cooling (ECCS), Auxiliary Feec:twater System (AFW), and Emergency AC Electrical Power Systems. COMPONENT 2-NRV-164-PU, Reactor Coolant Loop #4 to Pressurizer Spray Control Valve 2-NRV-164 Pneumatic Positioner [AB][PC] CAUSE OF THE EVENT Pressurizer spray valve 2-NRV-164 failed open due to debris lodged In the positioner spool valve. No point of use filtration was installed upstream of the spray valve positioner to protect from debris generation downstream of the control air after filter [LF][FL l]. A Root Cause Evaluation (RCE) was in progress at the time this LER was submitted. Any additional insights or causes found to be substantively different as descnbed in this LER will be reported in a supplement at that time. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Completed Corrective Actions The valve positioner and electro-pneumatic transmitter for 2-NRV-164 was replaced. Satisfactory diagnostic testing of 2-NRV-164 was completed which returned the valve back into service. Planned Corrective Actions Install point of use control air filtration or associated regulating valve with a filter upstream of single point vulnerable valve positioners susceptible to binding caused by small particulate.

Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 2 05000316 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES NUCLEAR SAFETY YEAR 2020 SEQUENTIAL NUMBER -003 REV NO. -00 There was no actual nuclear safety hazards resulting from 2-NRV-164 failing open, as an safeguard features performed as expected. The potential nuclear safety significance and consequences could have been more severe had the operators not responded as they did or if any of the safety features had not functioned property. INDUSTRIAL SAFETY There was no actual or potential industrial safety hazard resulting from 2-NRV-164 failing open. RADIOLOGICAL SAFETY There was no actual or potential radiological safety hazard resulting from 2-NRV-164 failing open. PROBABILISTIC RISK ASSESSMENT A Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) was completed. The safety significance of the event was derived by calculating the Conditional Core Damage Probability (CCDP) and the Conditional Large Earty Release Probability (CLERP) of the transient initiating event, with the current site Full-Power Internal Events PRA Model of Record. The assessment concluded that the event was of very low safety significance.

An Unusual Event was declared at 1258. All Safety Systems performed as designed. As a result of the LOOP, the 'A' and 'B' Emergency Diesel Generators automatically started and supplied power to the safety related busses. As a result, the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) automatically initiated and injected into the reactor. In addition, containment isolations occurred, as expected for this event. This resulted in a 4-hour event report to the NRC under 10 CFR 50.72 section 50.72{b)(2)(iv)(A) -ECCS Injection, 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) -RPS Actuation -Critical, 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) -Valid Specific System Actuation (reference EN#54826). The NOUE was exited at 1600 on August 11, 2020. The cause of the LOOP was an extremely severe storm (called a Derecho) with heavy rains and very high winds. This event had no impact on public health or safety. There were no systems, structures, or components inoperable at the time of the event that contributed to the event. This I event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50. 73(a)(2)(iv)(A), 50. 73(a)(2)(v)(C) and 50. 73(a)(2)(iii). There were no radiological releases associated with this event.

LER NUMBER SEQUENTIAL NUMBER -001 REV NO. -01 On August 10, 2020, at 1246 CDT, while operating at 80% power, NextEra Energy Duane Arnold· (DAEC) experienced a Generator Load reject and subsequent reactor scram as a result of a loss of offsite power (LOOP) due to extremely high winds. An Unusual Event was declared at 1258. All Safety Systems performed as designed. As a result of the LOOP, the 'A' and 'B' Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs) automatically started and supplied power to the safety related busses. In response to the expected Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) level transient, the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) automatically started and injected. In addition, containment isolations occurred, as expected for this event. This resulted in a 4-hour event report to the NRC under 10 CFR 50. 72 section 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(A) -ECCS Injection, 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) -RPS Actuation -Critical, 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) -Valid Specific System Actuation (reference EN#54826). The cause of the LOOP was an extremely severe storm ( called a Derecho) with heavy rains and very high winds. This event had no impact on public health or safety. There were no systems, structures, or components inoperable at the time of the event that contributed to the event. The Unusual Event was exited at 1600 on August 11, 2020. IL Assessment of Safety Consequences: In response to the LOOP, the plant experienced a Generator Lockout, Turbine Trip and Reactor Scram. The operating crew entered the appropriate emergency procedures. The EDG's quickly re-energized tlie safety-related electrical busses and restored power. The Reactor Protection System (RPS) power was never lost as the EDG's were able to recover power to the essential buses quickly. This prevented a Main Steam Isolation Valve (MSIV) isolation signal and thus allowed the Main Condenser to remain available post event. As expected for this event, RPV level dropped below L2 setpoint (119.5\") initiating the HPCI and RCIC systems. Reactor level recovered quickly. The Low Low Set System functioned as designed initially opening two primary system relief valves to control reactor pressure.

LER NUMBER SEQUENTIAL NUMBER -001 Operators were quickly able to establish pressure control initially via Steam Line Drains and RCIC and establish a cooldown rate. Both recirculating pumps tripped when power was lost to their associated non-safety related electrical busses. The operators followed procedures for cooldown with no forced circulation in the core. When Shutdown Cooling was placed in service, forced circulation was re-established which resulted in exceeding the bottom head cooldown limits of 100 degrees per hour. This was anticipated and could not be avoided. On August 12, a small cut was discovered in the Reactor Building 5th floor wall that was the result of storm damage. A test of the Secondary Containment boundary was conducted to determine the effect of the cut. The vacuum able to be drawn on secondary containment with one train of Standby Gas Treatment.System (SGTS) was 0.24 inches of water. The vacuum required to be drawn by Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement is 0.25 inches of water. Secondary Containment was declared inoperable with the plant not in the mode of applicability (Mode 4, Cold Shutdown). During a review of past operability of Secondary Containment, it was determined that the cut in the Reactor Building wall likely existed during the period the plant was cooling down in Mode 3, Hot Shutdown. Secondary Containment is required to be operable in Mode 3. DAEC design basis \\ndocuments state the design safety criteria for SGTS is to \"limit exfiltration from the secondary containment during periods of primary and/or secondary containment isolation\" and \"to control outward leakage of the atmosphere from the secondary containment\". Therefore, the safety function of SGTS and Secondary Containment was maintained by the ability to draw a substantial vacuum of 0.24 inches of water with the cut in the Reactor Building wall. Although the safety function of Secondary Containment and SGTS was maintained throughout this event, the reporting criteria in NUREG-1022 for 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C) states\" ... a report is required when 1) there is a determination that the SSC is inoperable in a required mode or other specified condition, 2) the inoperability is due to ... equipment failures ... , and 3) no redundant equipment in the same system was operable.\" Since Secondary Containment was declared inoperable, it meets the reporting criteria outlined in NUREG-1022. This event did not result in a Safety System Functional Failure.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER Duane Arnold Energy Center 05000-331 Ill. Cause of Event: YEAR 2020 3. LERNUMBER SEQUENTIAL NUMBER -001 The cause of the LOOP was an extremely severe storm (called a Derecho) with heavy rains and very high winds. Wind speeds exceeded 80 mph for over 20 minutes with peaks on site at greater than 100 mph. The National Weather Service later estimated wind speeds were likely near 130 mph. These winds resulted in all 6 off site power sources (4 -161 kV and 2 -\\n345 kV) coming into the DAEC switchyard being damaged or downed. A separate offsite 69 kV line which feeds non-essential plant loads was also damaged. IV. Corrective Actions: REV NO. -01 The high winds experienced on August 10, 2020 were not considered a beyond design basis event. The systems and components responded as designed and the overall peak wind speeds were within the Design Basis Tornado. The damage observed coincides with the amount of damage expected for the event. Given this event was outside the control of the station staff and that all components worked as designed, no additional corrective actions beyond repair/recovery efforts related to the wind storm are needed.

Abstract\\n (Limit to 1560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) \\nAt 23:02 Eastern Daylight Time on August \\n3, 2020, with Unit 1 in Mode 1 at approxim\\nately 19% power during Hurricane Isaias, a l\\noss of the transformer bus powering the Startup Auxiliary Transformer (\\nSAT) resulted in a Loss of Offs\\nite Power (LOOP). By design, \\nall Main Steam Isolation Valves closed and an \\nautomatic reactor scram occurred. All contro\\nl rods inserted as expected on the scram.\\n At the time of this event the main generator \\nwas removed from service due to unrelated ge\\nnerator ground issues and all plant loads\\n were \\nbeing supplied by the SAT. \\nBy design, the LOOP resulted in automatic \\nactuation of Primary Containm\\nent Isolation System (PCIS) \\nGroup 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 isol\\nation \\nvalves. In addition, all four emergency diesel generators (EDGs)\\n started, with EDGs 1 and 2 loadin\\ng to their respective emergen\\ncy buses per design. Reactor water level reached low level 1 followi\\nng the scram resulting in automat\\nic actuation of PCIS Groups 2\\n, 6, and 8, by design. \\nThe electrical fault that caused the transformer bus powering \\nthe SAT to trip and subsequent LOOP was determined to be a result\\n of storm generated debris. \\nThere was no impact on the health and safety of the public or \\nplant personnel. This event is being reported in accordance with \\n 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to valid actuation of\\n the Reactor Protection System, PCIS, and EDGs. \\n(See Page 3 for required number of digits/characters for each block) \\n(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form \\nhttp://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/\\n)  NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION \\n(08-2020) \\n LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) \\n CONTINUATION SHEET \\n(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form \\nhttp://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/\\n) APPROVED BY OMB:  NO. 3150-0104 EXPIRES:  08/31/2023 \\n Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

Unit 2\\n was in Mode 1 (i.e., Power Operation), at approx\\nimately 100 percent rated thermal power.  \\n Reportability Criteria \\n \\nThis event is being reported in accordanc\\ne with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A\\n) because it involved actuat\\nion of systems listed in  \\n10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). Specifically, the \\nReactor Protection System (RPS) [JC], Prim\\nary Containment Isolat\\nion System (PCIS) \\n[JM], and the Emergency Diesel Generators (EDG\\ns) [EK] actuated during this event.   \\n Per 10 CFR 50.72(a)(1)(i), the NRC was notified of an Unusual Ev\\nent (UE) being declared via Event Notification 54812 at 23:31 \\nEastern Daylight Time (EDT) on August 3,\\n 2020. The NRC was notified of the RPS [JC]\\n actuation while critical and the valid \\nspecified system actuations per \\n10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv\\n)(A), respectively, via an update to Event \\nNotification 54812 at 01:20 EDT on August 4, 2020.   \\n Event Description \\n \\nAt 23:02 EDT on August 3, 2020, \\nwith Unit 1 in Mode 1 at approximately 19% \\npower during Hurricane Isaias, a loss of the \\ntransformer bus powering the Startup Auxiliary Transformer (SAT) [EA] resulted in a Loss of Offsite Power (LOOP). By design, al\\nl Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIVs) [JM] closed and an automati\\nc reactor scram occurred. All c\\nontrol rods inserted as expected \\non the scram.   At the time of this event the main genera\\ntor was removed from service and all plant loads were being supplied by the SAT. Power\\n had been lowered to 19% prior to the event in preparation for \\nshutting down for maintenance associated with unrelated generator\\n ground issues.  \\n By design, the LOOP resulted in automatic\\n actuation of Primary Contai\\nnment Isolation System (PCIS)\\n Group 1 (i.e., main steam), \\nGroup 2 (i.e., floor and equipment drain), Group 3 (i.e., reac\\ntor water cleanup), Group 6 (i.e., monitoring and sampling), and \\nGroup 8 (i.e., shutdown cooling) isolation valves. In addition, all four \\nemergency diesel generators (EDG\\ns) started, with EDGs 1 and 2 loading to their respective emergency buses per design. Reacto\\nr water level reached low level 1 following the scram resulting i\\nn automatic actuation of PCIS Gr\\noups 2, 6, and 8, by design. \\n At 23:12 EDT on August 3, 2020, Unit 1 dec\\nlared a UE due to the LOOP. The UE wa\\ns exited at 14:54 on August 4, 2020.  \\n Event Cause \\n \\nExtensive investigation and testi\\nng concluded that the electrical \\nfault that caused the transformer bus powering the SAT to tri\\np and subsequent LOOP was not a result of an equi\\npment failure. The fault was determined to \\nbe a result of storm generated debris fro\\nm Hurricane Isaias.  \\n Safety Assessment \\n There was no adverse impact on the health and \\nsafety of the public. The safety significa\\nnce of this event is minimal. The autom\\natic reactor trip was as expected, and all safety related systems operated as designed. \\n     NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION \\n(08-2020) \\n LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) \\n CONTINUATION SHEET \\n(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form \\nhttp://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/\\n) APPROVED BY OMB:  NO. 3150-0104 EXPIRES:  08/31/2023 \\n Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

The valve was being tested to satisfy Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement (TS SR) 3.5.1.10, Verify each Automatic Depressurizing System (ADS) valve actuator strokes when manually actuated. All other Unit 2 ADS valves were found to stroke satisfactorily. The cause of the failure was an out of specification plunger received from the vendor. The failure will be prevented by determining and implementing appropriate purchase requirements to ensure new plungers meet the vendor specifications for this part. This is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specification. TS 3.5.1 Condition Hallows one ADS valve to be inoperable for a period of 14 days. This ADS valve was found to be inoperable for the entire cycle.

EVENT IDENTIFICATION Electromatic Relief Valve 3D Did Not Actuate due to Out of Specification Plunger A. CONDITION PRIOR TO EVENT Unit: 2 Event Date: March 30, 2020 Reactor Mode: 4 Mode Name: Cold Shutdowff-Event Time: 0530 hours CDT Power Level: 0% SEQUENTIAL NUMBER 002 REV NO. 00 There were no other structures, systems or components (SSC) inoperable during this event time period that could have contributed to this event. B. DESCRIPTION OF EVENT On March 30, 2020, with Unit 2 in shutdown for refueling outage 02525, during performance of the Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.5.1.10, the 2-0203-3D Electromatic Relief Valve (ERV)[RV] failed to actuate. TS SR 3.5.1.10 requires each Automatic Depressurizing System (ADS)[BF] valve actuator stroke when manually actuated. All other ADS valves on Unit 2 were found to stroke successfully. The 2-0203-3D actuator was replaced and stroked successfully prior to completion of refueling outage Q2R25 restoring the system to operable. The failed actuator for the 2-0203-3D ERV had been originally installed in March 2018 after having been rebuilt in February 2018 in preparation for the Q2R24 refueling outage. The actuator had been rebuilt in accordance with site maintenance rebuild procedure. On April 5, 2018, during an Auto Slowdown Functional Test operating surveillance, the 2-0203-3D ERV did not initially actuate as expected with the ERV remaining in the closed position. An Issue Report {IR) was generated, and troubleshooting was performed to smooth the actuator plunger sides to correct the actuator sticking. It was subsequently cycled three times successfully and was returned to service. Following the 2020 failure, the removed 2-0203-3D ERV actuator was dissembled and inspected to determine the cause of the failure. The initial observations and stroking of the actuator with the cover removed noted that the upper guide bracket was tilted down on the left end. As the actuator was stroked and returned to the standby state, the tilt of the upper guide bracket would vary from stroke to stroke causing the sticking of the actuator to be intermittent. Observation of the plunger during testing noted that it would intermittently rub with the lever arm on the left side. The plunger width was found to be different from the top \\nto mid-length indicating \\nthe legs are splaying. This plunger width was outside the manufacturer's tolerance for plunger width. The measured width of 2.592\" is 0.027\" larger than the manufacturer's toleranc.e for plunger width of 2.565\".

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER YEAR Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station Unit 2 05000-265 2020 -NARRATIVE 3. LER NUMBER SEQUENTIAL NUMBER 002 REV NO. 00 This is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specification. TS 3.5.1 Condition Hallows one ADS valve to be inoperable for a period of 14 days. The 2-0203-3D ERV was found to be inoperable for the entire cycle. C. CAUSE OF EVENT The cause of the failure was an out of specification plunger received from the vendor. The bent upper guide bracket was able to perform acceptably while installed during previous operating cycles but would only begin binding when initiated by the plunger. D. SAFETY ANALYSIS System Design The 2-0203-3D ERV is part of the ADS. The ADS consist of five valves [4 relief valves (ERVs) and one safety/relief valve (Target Rock valve)]. Per the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) 6.3.3.1.4, \"The ADS is designed to depressurize the reactor to permit either the Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) or Core Spray subsystem to cool the reactor core during a small breaker Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA).\" Pressure relief of the reactor vessel may be accomplished manually by the operator or without operator action by the automatic depressurization circuitry. Safety Impact Per TS Bases 3.5.1 Condition H.1, with one ADS valve out service, the overall reliability of the ADS is reduced, because a single failure in the OPERABLE ADS valves could result in a reduction in depressurization capability. In addition, TS Bases for SR 3.5.10 states the actuator of each of the ADS Electromatic valves (ERVs) and the dual function safety/relief valves (S/RVs) is stroked to verify that the pilot valve strokes when manually actuated. This SR, together with the valve testing performed as required by American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) code for pressure relieving devices, verify the capability of each relief valve to perform its function. Per UFSAR 6.3.3.1.4, Automatic Depressurization Subsystem, \"All five available ADS valve were assumed operable in the LOCA analysis. One ADS valve from the five valves modeled in the LOCA analyses was assumed to fail for the single failure evaluation resulting in the operation of four valves being credited.\" Based on the ADS system design and accident/transient analysis, four of five ADS valves are needed to perform the required safety function. An engineering evaluation concluded that the plant design/licensing bases were met for the past cycle (Q2C25) with the one failed ERV. Because of the number of successful stroke tests performed on the other ERVs, the out of specification plunger was determined not to be an issue with other ERVs. The target rock valve design is significantly different from the ERVs and therefore, this issue does not apply to the Target Rock valve. This event is a Maintenance Rule Functional Failure (MRFF).

The 30 ERV and actuator were replaced and successfully tested. Follow Up: 1. Determine and implement appropriate purchase requirements to ensure new plungers meet the vendor specifications. 2. In conjunction with the vendor, review plunger out of specification width for Part 21 implications. 3. Enhance Maintenance ERV actuator rebuild procedure to include the following: a. Improved upper guide bracket inspection criteria b. New alignment criteria c. Additional PMT strokes d. New plunger to switch plate check e. Ensure plunger width is within manufacturing specification or replace plunger F. PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES A review of previous QCNPS events reveals a similar event in 2010 in which the valve main disc would not open during its inspection. Similar to this event, the 2010 event resulted in the loss of one ERV for the entire cycle. 1. LER (254/2010-001-00) Electromatic Relief Valve Main Disc Failure -The cause of this ERV failure was determined to be improper torqueing during manufacturing valve assembly. This allowed a gap between the disc retainer and the main disc guide. This failure was in the body of the valve, where our current failure is contained in the valve actuator assembly. G. COMPONENT FAILURE DATA Failed Equipment: Relief Valve Actuator Component Manufacturer: General Electric Component Model Number: 362B2632G001 Component Part Number: N/A This event will be reported to IRIS.

Expected Submission Date) Abstract (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 14 single-spaced typewritten lines) On February 18, 2020 at approximately 0359, brass shavings were discovered on the upper crankcase of the 1 J \\nEmergency Diesel Generator (EDG) during planned maintenance activities. Maintenance activities further revealed degradation of the number one upper piston pin bushing. The piston pin bushing was replaced. The 1J EDG satisfactorily completed its return to service testing and was restored to operable status on 02/26/2020 at 1925. Investigation into the cause of failure concluded this \\ncondition occurred during the start of the 1J EDG test on 01/22/2020 impacting its ability to meet its 30-day mission time. The 1J EDG was conservatively determined to be inoperable since its last satisfactory test completed on 12/16/2019. Since 12/16/2019, the 1 H EDG was inoperable for normal maintenance and surveillance activities for approximately 39.5 hours. This results in 1 J \\nand 1 H EDG being inoperable concurrently corresponding to an event that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of a system needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident (10 CFR 50. 73(a)(2)(v)(D)). A Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications (T.S.) is also reported due to 1 J \\nEDG inoperability and concurrent inoperability with 1 H EDG greater than T.S. allowed outage times (10 CFR 50. 73(a)(2)(i)(B)). There were no actual safety consequences due to this event. The health and safety of the public were not affected by this event.

LER .,, ŁŁŁ~~ North Anna Power Station Unit 1 05000-338 NARRATIVE 1,0 Qescrjptjon of the Event YEAR 2020 Ł SEQUENTIAL NUMBER 001 REV NO. 01 On February 18, 2020 at approximately 0359 with Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 100% power and Unit 2 in Mode 1 at 100% power, brass shavings were discovered on the upper crankcase of the Unit 1 \"J\" (1 J) Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG)(EIIS Component DG, System EK) during planned maintenance activities. Maintenance activities further revealed degradation of the number one upper piston pin bushing. The apparent cause was determined to be a d~gradation of the connecting rod (small end) aluminum cooling oil spherical retainer ring which resulted in increased oil flow and inadequate lubrication between the piston pin and piston pin bushing. Industry operating experience and discussions with Fairbanks Morse (EIIS Manufacturer: F010) , the EDG vendor, determined this to be an isolated failure. As contributor trend analysis of the engine oil copper concentration did not support removal of the EDG from service prior to challenging system functionality. Copper levels in the oil samples of the 1J EDG had been elevated however stayed below all vendor recommended action levels. The 1 J \\nEDG is one of two required EDG capable of supplying the onsite Class 1 E \\npower distribution subsystems for Unit 1. North Anna Unit 2 also has two EDGs. There were no similar indications of copper or other metals present in oil samples from the other EDGs on Unit 1 or Unit 2. The piston pin bushing was replaced along with associated components. The 1J EDG satisfactorily completed its return to service testing and was restored to operable status on 02/26/2020 at 1925. The initiating event that resulted in the degraded number one upper piston pin bushing occurred during the start of the 1 J \\nEDG test on 01/22/2020 impacting its ability to meet its 30-day mission time. A prior operability assessment determined the 1 J \\nEDG to have been inoperable since its last satisfactory surveillance test conducted on 12/16/2019. This determination of inoperability of 1 J \\nEDG results in a Condition Prohibited by Technical Specification (T.S.) specifically T.S. 3.8.1 Condition B for an allowed completion time of 14 days to restore the EDG to operable status (10 CFR 50. 73(a)(2)(i} (B)). Since 12/16/2019, the 1 H \\nEDG was inoperable for normal maintenance and surveillance activities for approximately 39.5 hours. This results in a total outage time for 1 J \\nand 1 H \\nEDG concurrently corresponding to an event that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of a system needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident (10 CFR 50. 73(a)(2)(v)(D)) and a Condition Prohibited by T.S. specifically T.S. 3.8.1 Condition I that requires one of the two inoperable EDGs to be restored to operable status with an allowed completion time of 2 hours (10 CFR 50. 73(a)(2}(i) (8)). 2,0 Sjanjfjcant Safety consequences and lroplicat;ons The 1 H \\nEDG was operable during the planned maintenance activities on 1 J \\nEDG. There were no actual significant safety consequences. The health and safety of the public were not affected by this event. 3,o cause of the Event The degradation associated with the 1 J \\nEmergency Diesel Generator number 1 upper cylinder piston pin bushing has been determined to be isolated specifically to the 1J Emergency Diesel Generator. An inadequate lubrication between the piston pin and piston pin bushing resulted from increased oil flow due to degradation of a connecting rod cooling oil spherical retainer ring.

Supplemental Report Expected Month Day Year D 0 15. Expected Submission Date Yes (If yes, complete 15. Expected Submission Date) No Abstract (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 14 single-spaced typewritten lines) At 2144 [EST] on 11/20/2019, with Unit 2 at 100 percent power, all three (3) Unit 2 Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) pumps were declared inoperable due to the Unit 2 Turbine Driven (TD) AFW pump discharge check valve failing to completely close, which caused flow from a running Unit 2 Motor Driven (MD) AFW to partially recirculate back to the Emergency Condensate Storage Tank. At 2203 the two (2) MDAFW pumps were declared operable after the discharge isolation valves for the TDAFW pump were closed. The Unit 2 TDAFW discharge check valve condition existed from 10/28/19 to 11 /20/19 and could have adversely impacted the ability of AFW to function properly. The cause of this event was determined to be excessive wear on the discharge check valve disc assembly parts causing the disc to stick partially open. The safety consequences associated with this event are bounded by the safety analyses documented in UFSAR Chapter 14. The affected check valve's internal assembly parts were replaced. To prevent recurrence, a corrective action is planned to periodically inspect and/or replace the check valve internals, as needed, on both units. Unit 1 \\nwas not impacted by this event since it was in cold shutdown at the time.

Plant Operation Conditions Before the Event Event Date: 11/20/2019 Unit 1: 0 Percent Power (Cold Shutdown) Unit 2: 100 Percent Power Background: The Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) system [EIIS: BA] is a safety-related system except for the initiating signals of the reactor coo.lant [EIIS: AC] buses undervoltage feature, the main feedwater pump [EIIS: SJ-P] breaker trip feature, the loss of reserve station power feature, and the AMSAC feature. The initiating circuitry incorporates both automatic ar:i<tl manual system start capability, including manual initiation of the system from the control room. · ,, The AFW system consists principally of one (1) 100 percent capacity Turbine-Driven Auxiliary Fee<fjwater (TDAFW) pump [EIIS: BA-P] rated for 700 gpm, two (2) 50 percent capacity Motor-Driven Auxiliary Feedwater (MDAFW) pumps [EIIS: P] rated for 350 gpm, a 110,000-gallon storage tank, and associated piping, valves, and controls. The turbine-driven pump and the electrically-driven pumps represent two diverse pumping systems that operate \\nautomatically to supply auxiliary feedwater to the steam generators. These three (3) pumps are in parallel and provide flow to two common discharge headers. The discharge line of each pump contains a discharge check valve [EIIS: BA-VJ horizontally mounted . downstream of each AFW pump. 1hese check valves are a Critical Class 1 component which are tested open every quarter and tested to close every refueling outage in accordance with the 1ST program. Additionally, the Units 1 and 2 AFW systems can be cross-tied to ensure that in the event of a postulated high energy line break in the Main Steam Vaive House or a fire that disables the auxiliary feedwater pumps, the unaffected system will have the ability of maintaining both units in a hot shutdown condition. · B. Description of Event: On 11/20/2019, an AFW cross-tie capability test from Unit 2 to Unit 1 was performed. For the test, the Unit 2 \"B\" MDAFW pump was started to pressurize the AFW discharge header. Rather than closing the manual isolation valves, isolation of the other Unit 2 MDAFW and TDAFW pumps was accomplished by crediting each pump's discharge check valve. The purpose of this action was to prevent having to declare all the Unit 2 AFW pumps inoperable while running the test. Shortly after the Unit 2 ''B\" MDAi=W pump was started, an operator in the field reported the Unit 2 TDAFW pump was turning backwards. This allowed flow from the running Unit 2 MDAFW pump to partially recirculate back to the Emergency Condensate Storage Tank. As a result, all three (3) Unit 2 AFW pumps were declared inoperable. After isolating the discharge check valve, both Unit 2 MDAFW pumps were declared operable. Unit 2 remained in a 72-hour Technical Specification action statement to restore the Unit 2 TDAFW pump. Troubleshooting determined that the backward rotation had been caused by the Unit 2 TDAFW pump discharge check valve that had not fully closed. It was concluded that the discharge check valve failing to completely close occurred during the performance of the last quarterly Unit 2 TDAFW pump flow surveillance test on 10/28/2019 and that between 10/28/2019 and 11/20/2019 this condition could have prevented the Unit 2 AFW System from functioning properly; consequently, this report is being submitted pursuant to 10 CFR 50. 73 (a)(2)(v)(B), as an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function of SSCs needed to remove residual heat.

C. Cause of Event: The direct cause of the check valve failure was due to excessive wear on the check valve disc assembly parts. The internal valve assembly for this valve was last replaced in 1993. The root cause was that no scheduled preventative maintenance was being performed on the Unit 2 TDAFW pump discharge check valve due to decisions made in 1996 and 2005 to rely on back leakage checks vs. performing check valve open and inspect. As a result, the station was not monitoring the extent of the wear occurring on the valve internals. D. Safety Consequences The safety consequences of postulated accident scenarios rely on the availability of the AFW system to provide water to the steam generators for the purpose of removing core decay heat during and after the postulated accident scenarios. Limiting analysis assumptions for evaluation of such scenarios include a loss of offsite power rendering the Main Feedwater (MFW) pumps unavailable. For the \\nduration of the Unit 2 AFW system unavailability period in question, Surry Power Station retained offsite power. This ensured that the Unit 2 MFW system was available as an alternate method of providing water to the steam generators and, therefore, ensuring a source of secondary coolant. -; A review of station logs identified that, if the Unit 2 MFW system were unavailable for any reason, additional depth was provided by the station cross-tie piping. Using this piping, at least one (1) Unit 1 motor driven AFW pump was available to provide water to the Unit 2 steam generators for all but five (5) hours of the period in question, when the cross-tie was unavailable for testing on 11/15/2019. During this five (5) hours of unavailability, it is estimated that the capability to resupply water to Unit 2 would have taken less than 1 hour if needed. Further, isolation of the unanalyzed flow path through the Unit 2 TDAFW pump discharge line, which restored the operability of the Unit 2 AFW system, was completed within 20 minutes of identifying the Unit 2 TDAFW pump was rotating backward on 11/20/2019. This demonstrates that operability of the Unit 2 AFW system could have been promptly restored in response to an actual event. Consequently, the safety consequences associated with this event were bounded by the safety analyses documented in UFSAR Chapter 14. Risk Significance: The initiating events most challenging for this event are Emergency Switchgear Room (ESGR) floods and plant transients. ESGR floods have the potential to disable all emergency power, leaving only the Unit 1 or 2 TDAFW pumps to provide secondary cooling. Plant transients typically rely on AFW as the primary source of decay heat removal, so a challenge to AFW would require operators to either align the Auxiliary Feedwater cross-tie, Main Feedwater, Condensate, or use feed and bleed for decay heat removal.

Expected Submission Date Abstract (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 14 single-spaced typewritten lines) On March 9, 2019, at approximately 2259 Central Standard Time (CST), Browns Ferry Unit 3 received an automatic Reactor SCRAM from 100 percent power as a result of a Turbine Load Reject. Browns Ferry Unit 3 declared a Notification of Unusual Event due to loss of the 500kV offsite source. The automatic SCRAM occurred as a Licensed Reactor Operator (LRO) made adjustments to lower incoming reactive power on Unit 3 at the request of the Balancing Authority. The LRO incorrectly operated a hand switch and changed the automatic voltage regulator (AVR) from auto to manual. In this mode of operation, the dynamic limiter is removed, which allows Operations personnel to adjust Mega Volt Amps Reactive (MVAR) beyond the Under Excitation Limiter (UEL) protection setting. As a result, the generator circuit breaker tripped causing a Turbine Load reject and an automatic SCRAM. All safety systems actuated as designed. The root cause for this event was determined to be that Operations department leaders have allowed continued negative human performance (HU) behaviors by inconsistently providing coaching or reinforcing the use of appropriate HU barriers. The corrective action to prevent recurrence is to revise the Operations Excellence Program, BFN-ODM-4.28, to require use of a dynamic learning environment to develop Operations Department Leaders' skills in coaching and reinforcing the use of appropriate HU barriers. Training will be required prior to assuming shift following initial qualification as Nuclear Unit Senior Operators (NUSO) and Shift Managers (SM). The currently qualified NUSOs and SMs have received training. A plastic cover was placed over the manual/auto select voltage regulator hand switch on all three Units to mitigate unintentional operation of the AVR from automatic to manual control. The Operating Instruction procedure for the Turbine Generator System was revised to prompt Operations personnel to validate the initial status of the AVR prior to adjusting MVAR.

Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event At the time of discovery, Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant (BFN), Unit 3, was in Mode 1 at approximately 100 percent power. II. Description of Event A. Event Summary 001 On March 9, 2019, at approximately 2259 Central Standard Time (CST), Browns Ferry Unit 3 received an automatic Reactor SCRAM from 100 percent power as a result of a Turbine [TRB] Load Reject. The automatic SCRAM occurred as a Licensed Reactor Operator (LRO) made adjustments to lower incoming reactive power on Unit 3 at the request of the Balancing Authority (BA). The request was made by the BA to address a high voltage condition on the 500kV transmission system. During the adjustment, a LRO incorrectly operated a hand switch [HS], placing the Automatic Voltage Regulator [RG] (AVR) in manual control, and adjusted Mega Volt Amps Reactive (MVAR) beyond the Under Excitation [EXC] Limiter (UEL) protection setting. After two seconds, the generator excitation remained below the protection setting, which initiated a loss of excitation trip resulting in loss of the generator exciter field. Incoming MVAR and current increased on all three generator phases resulting in actuation of generator overcurrent protective relays [RL Y] and opening of the Unit 3 high-side breakers [BKR]. The generator circuit breaker tripped causing a Turbine Load Reject and automatic SCRAM. Systems that actuated as a result of the automatic SCRAM include those listed in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). Primary Containment Isolation Systems [JE] (PCIS) Groups 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 isolation signals were received. High Pressure Coolant Injection [BG] (HPCI) and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling [BN] (RCIC) initiated on low reactor water level. All four Unit 3 Diesel Generators [EK][DG] (DGs) started and loaded as expected and supplied AC power to their respective 4kV Shutdown Boards as designed. Browns Ferry Unit 3 declared a Notification of Unusual Event (NOUE) due to loss of the 500kV offsite source. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is submitting this report in accordance with Title 10 CFR 50. 73(a)(2)(iv)(A), as any event or condition that resulted in a manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B).

Analysis of the event The voltage regulator manual/auto select hand switch was operated incorrectly, thereby swapping the AVR from automatic to manual control mode. In this mode of operation, the dynamic limiter is removed, which allows Operations personnel to adjust MVAR below the UEL. The dynamic protection setpoint (10 percent protection limit) remains active when in manual mode. After reaching the setpoint of the 10 percent protection limit, the AVR swapped active channels. Seconds later, with MVAR still below the limit, the AVR tripped the exciter circuit breaker. As excitation lowered, the generator began to reverse power, resulting in the Turbine trip and automatic reactor SCRAM. V. Assessment of Safety Consequences 01 This event resulted in the automatic actuation of safety systems. This event did not result in the inoperability or unavailability of any system to provide their required safety functions. Therefore, this condition was of low safety significance and had negligible impact on the health and safety of the public. A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the components and systems that failed during the event No systems or components failed during this event. B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions, remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the consequences of an accident This event did not occur when the reactor was shutdown. C. For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, estimate of the elapsed time from discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service Safety system availability was not impacted by this event. VI. Corrective Actions Corrective Actions are being managed by TVA's Corrective Action Program (CAP) under Condition Report 1497448. A.

Expected Submission Date Abstract (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 14 single-spaced typewritten lines) On 6/13/18, during a surveillance test of the E-3 Emergency Diesel Generator, higher than normal engine temperatures were noted and abnormal noises were heard while running the engine at full load. The engine was shut down and troubleshooting initiated. Inspection of the turbocharger air inlet check valve discovered a pin used to hold the check valve disc in place was missing. The pin had become dislodged and had traveled to the turbocharger, where it caused damage to the rotating blades of the turbocharger. Repairs were performed and the diesel generator was placed back in service on 6/23/18. Investigation of the failure determined that inadequate repairs during maintenance in April 2017 resulted in the pin loosening at certain engine loads. This event is being reported as required by 1 OCFR 50.73(a)(2)(i}(B}.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER YEAR Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station Unit 2 05000277 2018 -NARRATIVE Unit Conditions Prior to the Event SEQUENTIAL NUMBER 002 REV NO. -01 Unit 2 and Unit 3 were both operating in Mode 1 at approximately 100% rated thermal power. There were no structures, systems or components out of service that contributed to this event. Description of Event On 6/13/18, a periodic surveillance test was being performed on the E-3 Emergency Diesel Generator (EOG). The test is performed to verify the EOG can slow start and run at full load for at least one hour. The EDG was started and after approximately 40 minutes, brought up to full load (2700 -2800 kW). After approximately 30 minutes of operating at full load, temperature readings indicated higher than normal exhaust temperatures at several locations. After further observation and indications of higher than normal operating temperatures, the decision was made to shut down the engine. As the EDG was being shutdown, a rattling noise was heard in the area of the turbocharger. The EDG operated at full load for approximately 55 minutes. Troubleshooting centered around the turbocharger air inlet check valve, which allows for an increased flow of air to the turbocharger air inlet as the load on the engine increases. Inspection identified a pin used to hold the check valve disk to the pivot shaft was missing and had entered the air inlet piping. Air intake for the engine's two turbochargers is initially through a common pipe, which splits to direct air to each turbocharger. The dislodged pin bounced between the two turbochargers, causing damage to the aluminum turbocharger blades. The damage resulted in aluminum particles being distributed through the air intake, lube oil and exhaust systems. Aluminum particles were also found in the cylinders of the engine. Larger aluminum particles were caught in the intercooler fins. Repairs included replacing the air inlet check valve, replacing the turbochargers, removing larger particles of the impeller blades from the intercooler inlet, cleaning the cylinder liners, replacing piston rings and flushing the lubricating oil system. Post maintenance testing was performed, and the diesel generator was placed back in service on 6/23/18. Analysis of Event The onsite standby power source for the four 4 kV emergency buses in each unit consists of four EDGs. Each EOG can supply power to two 4 kV buses, one for each unit. Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.1, Condition B, provides required actions when one EDG is inoperable. These actions include determining that the remaining EDGs are not inoperable due to a common cause failure and restoring the EOG to an operable status within 14 days. The pin that had become dislodged from the E-3 EOG air inlet check valve had been replaced during preventive maintenance performed in April 2017. The pin was manufactured on site and was unique to the NRC FORM 366A (04-2018) Page _2_ of _.L..

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LEA NUMBER YEAR Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station Unit 2 05000277 2018 -NARRATIVE SEQUENTIAL NUMBER 002 E-3 EOG. The air inlet check valves for the three remaining EOGs were inspected with no concerns identified. All three EOGs remained operable while E-3 was being repaired. REV NO. 01 Repairs were completed, post-maintenance testing performed and the E-3 EOG was declared operable at 7:1 O pm on 6/23/18. As a result of this event, the E-3 EOG was inoperable for repairs for approximately 9 days, 21 hours. The previous surveillance test was performed on 5/20/18, 24 days prior to the failed surveillance on 6/13/18. Analysis determined the E-3 EOG may not have been able to perform its design function for the seven day mission time since April 2017, prior to the preventive maintenance activities that replaced the pin. As a result, the E-3 EOG is considered to have been inoperable for a total of approximately 443 days. This exceeds the TS 3.8.1 allowed outage time of 14 days. As a result, this event is being reported in accordance with 1 OCFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), for any operation or condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. There were no actual safety consequences as a result of this event. The plant's safety analysis assumes one EOG is unavailable. If a design basis event had occurred during the time the E-3 EOG was inoperable, the units could have been safely shutdown with the three remaining EOGs. Cause of the Event The cause was determined to be less than adequate repairs to the air inlet check valve during maintenance performed in April of 2017. Several causal factors existed, including shaft bushing wear and inadequate shaft to disk fit, which resulted in higher vibration of the shaft and disk. With the higher vibration, tolerances for the interference fit of the pin to the disk shaft were not adequate to prevent the pin from becoming dislodged. Corrective Actions The valve disk, shaft and bushings were replaced and repairs to the EOG were performed as described above. Additional causal factors and corrective actions are documented in the corrective action program. Previous Similar Occurrences No previous similar occurrences have been identified.

EXPECTED SUBMISSION DATE) NO SUBMISSION DATE !ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) On January 8, 2019, the Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) system was declared inoperable. This action was taken because the RCIC system turbine-pump did not achieve the acceptance criteria of flow rate, discharge pressure, and speed during the performance of a surveillance test. Due to the unexpected response \\na Failure Modes Analysis was initiated to determine the cause. No deficient conditions were identified during troubleshooting. However, based on the investigation, the team determined that the direct cause was output signal loss from the RCIC flow controller. A spare calibrated controller was installed, the system was tested, and successfully returned to service. The High Pressure Coolant Injection system was operable and capable of providing high pressure core cooling similar to the RCIC system. This event had no impact on the health and/or safety of the public. This report is submitted in accordance with Title 1 O Code of Federal Regulations 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D).

FACILITYNAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LEA NUMBER YEAR Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station 05000-293 2019 NARRATIVE BACKGROUND SEQUENTIAL NUMBER -001 REV NO. -00 The Pilgrim Station Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) states that the Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) system is designed to provide makeup water to the reactor vessel following reactor isolation in order to prevent the release of radioactive materials to the environment as a result of inadequate reactor core cooling. The system consists of a steam driven turbine-pump and associated valves and piping capable of delivering makeup water to the reactor vessel over a range of reactor pressures. The system can be operated automatically or manually, and is one of the systems credited in the UFSAR for a design basis Control Rod Drop Accident (CRDA). The RCIC system is sufficient to maintain reactor \\nvessel water level at an acceptable limit during \\nthis event. EVENT DESCRIPTION On January 8, 2019, the RCIC turbine was started in automatic from the main control room per a quarterly ~urveillance. During the test run, the turbine did not reach rated conditions. Operators identified that flow controller, FIC-1340-01, output meter was indicating zero, which was unexpected. Operators attempted to change demand by varying the flow controller setpoint from 375 gallons per minute (gpm) to 425 gpm, but no change in output or flow occurred. Operators then manually stopped the RCIC turbine from the main control room and declared the RCIC system inoperable. rrhe NRG Operations Center was notified of the event in accordance with Title 1 O Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 50. 72 at 1545 hours on January 8, 2019. The event occurred during power operation while at 100 percent reactor power. The reactor mode selector switch was in the RUN position. CAUSE OF THE EVENT Due to the unexpected response a Failure Modes Analysis was initiated to investigate the cause. No deficient conditions were identified during troubleshooting. However, based on the investigation, the team determined that the direct cause was output signal loss from RCIC flow controller FIC-1340-01. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS rrhe installed flow controller was removed and replaced with a spare calibrated controller. An operability test run was completed and the system was successfully returned to service. ~ny further corrective actions will be documented in the corrective action program.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER YEAR Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station 05000-293 2019 SAFETY CONSEQUENCES SEQUENTIAL NUMBER -001 REV NO. -00 The RCIC system function is to provide high pressure makeup water to the reactor vessel after isolation of the vessel. The RCIC and High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) systems provide Single-Failure Proof response to high pressure reactor vessel injection following a CRDA. The HPCI system was operable while the RCIC system was inoperable. If the HPCI system were to become inoperable and core cooling was necessary, the automatic depressurization system would depressurize the reactor in order to allow low pressure core cooling by the residual heat removal system (low pressure coolant injection mode), and/or core spray system. There were no actual consequences to safety of the general public, nuclear safety, industrial safety, or radiological safety for this event based on the availability of appropriate high pressure core cooling. REPORT ABILITY The condition is reportable under 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73 based on NUREG-1022 guidance as a condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function because the RCIC system was inoperable as defined in the Technical Specifications. However, the condition is not a safety system functional failure because an engineering evaluation concluded that the safety function would have been fulfilled by HPCI, if high pressure core cooling were needed. HPCI was operable at the time that RCIC failed to meet it surveillance requirements and was declared inoperable.

The probability of basic event FLX\\n-\\nXHE\\n-\\nXE\\n-\\nELAP \\n(\\noperators fail to declare ELAP when bene\\nficial\\n) was set to its nominal value of 10\\n-\\n2\\n \\nto \\nactivate the credit for FLEX mitigation strategies for postulated SBO scenarios for which \\nan extended loss of AC power (ELAP) is declared.\\n \\nLER 338\\n-\\n2020\\n-\\n001\\n \\n \\n3\\n \\n\\n \\nFLEX Reliability Parameters\\n.  FLEX hardware reliability parameters su\\nitable for inclusion \\nin the NRC SPAR models is not yet available.  Therefore, the base SPAR models \\ncurrently use the reliability parameters of permanently installed equipment, which is \\ninconsistent with the limited experience with the operation of FLEX equ\\nipment.  As part \\nof an NRC audit performed of preliminary FLEX hardware data provided by the \\n\\nreviewed the FLEX hardware parameters estimated by the PWROG.  This review \\nrevealed that\\n \\nFLEX diesel generator failure\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nstart (FTS) probability is 3 to 10\\n \\ntimes \\nhigher and failure\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nrun (FTR) rate is 2 to 5\\n \\ntimes higher than permanently installed \\nEDGs.  The portable engine\\n-\\ndriven centrifugal pump FTS probability is at least 8\\n \\ntimes \\nhigher \\nand FTR rate is at least 6\\n \\ntimes higher than permanently installed pumps.  See \\nTable\\n \\n1 in \\nINL/EXT\\n-\\n20\\n-\\n58327\\n\\n(ADAMS Accession No.\\n \\nML20155K834) for additional information.  Therefore, to provide \\na more representative estimate of the FLEX hardware reliability parameters, this \\nanalysis increased the hardware reliability by a factor of three in the best estimate case.\\n \\n\\n \\nRemoval of EDG Repa\\nir Credit for ELAP Scenarios\\n.  The base SPAR model provides \\ncredit for repair of postulated EDG \\nfailures for SBO scenarios.  However, this potential \\ncredit is not applicable for scenarios where ELAP will be declared because (a.) operators \\nwill be focused o\\nn implementing the FLEX mitigation strategies and (b.) the DC load \\nshedding activities could preclude recovery of EDGs.  Therefore, credit for EDG repair \\ncredit was removed from the sequences if it is included after ELAP is likely declared \\n(i.e.,\\n \\n1\\n \\nhour)\\n.\\n \\n\\n \\n72\\n-\\nHour AC Power Recovery Requirement\\n.  The base SPAR model requires AC power \\nrecovery within 72\\n \\nhours \\nfor a safe/stable end state for ELAP scenarios with successful \\nFLEX implementation.  If AC power is not recovered in these scenarios, the SPAR \\nmodels ass\\nume core damage.  The American Society of Mechanical \\nEngineers/American Nuclear Society probabilistic risk assessment standard definition for \\nsafe/stable end state does not require AC power recovery.  Because of the large \\nuncertainty in modeling assumption\\ns related to availability and reliability of components \\nand strategies for mission times that are well beyond 24 hours and the unclear basis for \\nrequiring AC power recovery within 72\\n \\nhours, the 72\\n-\\nhour AC power requirement was \\neliminated in this analysis\\n. \\n \\nAs part of this change, the FTR events for FLEX diesel \\ngenerators and pumps have a 72\\n-\\nhour mission time in the base SPAR model.

Expected Submission Date) Abstract (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 14 single-spaced typewritten lines) On February 18, 2020 at approximately 0359, brass shavings were discovered on the upper crankcase of the 1 J \\nEmergency Diesel Generator (EDG) during planned maintenance activities. Maintenance activities further revealed degradation of the number one upper piston pin bushing. The piston pin bushing was replaced. The 1J EDG satisfactorily completed its return to service testing and was restored to operable status on 02/26/2020 at 1925. Investigation into the cause of failure concluded this \\ncondition occurred during the start of the 1J EDG test on 01/22/2020 impacting its ability to meet its 30-day mission time. The 1J EDG was conservatively determined to be inoperable since its last satisfactory test completed on 12/16/2019. Since 12/16/2019, the 1 H EDG was inoperable for normal maintenance and surveillance activities for approximately 39.5 hours. This results in 1 J \\nand 1 H EDG being inoperable concurrently corresponding to an event that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of a system needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident (10 CFR 50. 73(a)(2)(v)(D)). A Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications (T.S.) is also reported due to 1 J \\nEDG inoperability and concurrent inoperability with 1 H EDG greater than T.S. allowed outage times (10 CFR 50. 73(a)(2)(i)(B)). There were no actual safety consequences due to this event. The health and safety of the public were not affected by this event.

LER .,, ŁŁŁ~~ North Anna Power Station Unit 1 05000-338 NARRATIVE 1,0 Qescrjptjon of the Event YEAR 2020 Ł SEQUENTIAL NUMBER 001 REV NO. 01 On February 18, 2020 at approximately 0359 with Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 100% power and Unit 2 in Mode 1 at 100% power, brass shavings were discovered on the upper crankcase of the Unit 1 \"J\" (1 J) Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG)(EIIS Component DG, System EK) during planned maintenance activities. Maintenance activities further revealed degradation of the number one upper piston pin bushing. The apparent cause was determined to be a d~gradation of the connecting rod (small end) aluminum cooling oil spherical retainer ring which resulted in increased oil flow and inadequate lubrication between the piston pin and piston pin bushing. Industry operating experience and discussions with Fairbanks Morse (EIIS Manufacturer: F010) , the EDG vendor, determined this to be an isolated failure. As contributor trend analysis of the engine oil copper concentration did not support removal of the EDG from service prior to challenging system functionality. Copper levels in the oil samples of the 1J EDG had been elevated however stayed below all vendor recommended action levels. The 1 J \\nEDG is one of two required EDG capable of supplying the onsite Class 1 E \\npower distribution subsystems for Unit 1. North Anna Unit 2 also has two EDGs. There were no similar indications of copper or other metals present in oil samples from the other EDGs on Unit 1 or Unit 2. The piston pin bushing was replaced along with associated components. The 1J EDG satisfactorily completed its return to service testing and was restored to operable status on 02/26/2020 at 1925. The initiating event that resulted in the degraded number one upper piston pin bushing occurred during the start of the 1 J \\nEDG test on 01/22/2020 impacting its ability to meet its 30-day mission time. A prior operability assessment determined the 1 J \\nEDG to have been inoperable since its last satisfactory surveillance test conducted on 12/16/2019. This determination of inoperability of 1 J \\nEDG results in a Condition Prohibited by Technical Specification (T.S.) specifically T.S. 3.8.1 Condition B for an allowed completion time of 14 days to restore the EDG to operable status (10 CFR 50. 73(a)(2)(i} (B)). Since 12/16/2019, the 1 H \\nEDG was inoperable for normal maintenance and surveillance activities for approximately 39.5 hours. This results in a total outage time for 1 J \\nand 1 H \\nEDG concurrently corresponding to an event that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of a system needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident (10 CFR 50. 73(a)(2)(v)(D)) and a Condition Prohibited by T.S. specifically T.S. 3.8.1 Condition I that requires one of the two inoperable EDGs to be restored to operable status with an allowed completion time of 2 hours (10 CFR 50. 73(a)(2}(i) (8)). 2,0 Sjanjfjcant Safety consequences and lroplicat;ons The 1 H \\nEDG was operable during the planned maintenance activities on 1 J \\nEDG. There were no actual significant safety consequences. The health and safety of the public were not affected by this event. 3,o cause of the Event The degradation associated with the 1 J \\nEmergency Diesel Generator number 1 upper cylinder piston pin bushing has been determined to be isolated specifically to the 1J Emergency Diesel Generator. An inadequate lubrication between the piston pin and piston pin bushing resulted from increased oil flow due to degradation of a connecting rod cooling oil spherical retainer ring.

Cook \\nNuclear Plant\\ns 1 and 2 created \\nin December \\n2020.  This \\nTLU model includes an \\ninadver\\ntent SI actuation \\nevent\\n tree to allow the modeling of this \\nevent\\n. 3.3 SPAR Model Modifications\\n The following SPAR model modifications were made to support this analysis:\\n  The event tree branch for th\\ne ISINJ (\\ninadvertent SI\\n) event tree was modified.  \\nSpecifically, the transfers to the \\nSLOCA (\\nsmall LOCA\\n) event tree were removed \\nand replace\\nd by branching within the parent event tree.\\n  These changes eliminate \\nunnecessary queries in the SLOCA event tree.  \\nIn addition, the\\n OEP (\\nconsequential loss \\nof offsite power\\n) top event\\n and transfer to the \\nLOOPPC (\\nplant\\n-centered loss of offsite \\npower\\n) event tree was inserted\\n to account for potential consequential LOOP during the \\nevent\\n.  The transfer for the failure of the reactor protection sys\\ntem sequence was \\n 1  ASP analyses also \\naccount for any degraded condition(s) that were identified after the initiating event occurred if\\n the failure/degradation exposure \\ntime\\n(s) overlapped the initiating event date.\\n LER \\n316-2020-003  3 changed\\n to the ATWS (\\nanticipated transient without scram\\n) event tree.  The modified \\nISINJ \\nevent tree is \\nprovided in \\nFigure\\n A-1 of Appendix\\n A.  Basic event \\nPPR-PRV\\n-CO-TRANS \\n(PORVs/SRVs open during \\ntransient\\n) was changed \\nto its complement\\n under gate PORV\\n-4 in the PORV (\\nPORVs are closed\\n) fault tree.\\n  This \\nchange \\nwas made to account for the pressurizer safety relief valves not being \\nchallenged if the PORVs lift during the SI actuation.\\n 3.4 Analysis\\n Assumpt\\nions The following modeling assumptions were determined to be significant to the modeling of this \\ninitiating \\nevent assessment:\\n  The probability of IE\\n-ISINJ\\n (inadvertent safety injection\\n) was set to 1.0 due to \\nautomatic \\nSI actuation\\n.  All other \\ninitiating event probabilities were set to zero.\\n  Basic event\\n PPR-PRV\\n-CO-TRANS \\nwas set to TRUE because the PORVs opened s\\neven\\n times during the event response.\\n  The pressurizer PORVs \\nexperience \\nseven\\n demands\\n due to high RCS pressure as a \\nresult of the SI a\\nctu\\nation.  T\\no account for the increased failure of these \\nPORVs\\n to successfully reclose after the opening, the associated failure probabilities were modified \\nusing binominal expansion to account for their greater likelihood of failure.  Basic event\\n ZT-PRV-OO-PZR-R1 (one pressurizer PORV fails to reclose after scram\\n) was\\n set to \\n1×10-2. 4 ANALYSIS RESULTS \\n  4.1 Results\\n The mean\\n CCDP \\nfor this analysis is calculated to be \\n1×10-5.  The ASP Program threshold \\nfor \\ninitiating events \\nis a CCDP of \\n10-6 or the \\nplant\\n-specific \\nCCDP of an uncomplicated reactor trip \\nwith a non\\n-recoverable loss of feedwater or the condenser heat sink, whichever is greater. \\n This \\nCCDP equivalent for \\nD.C.

As Reactor Coolant System (RCS) pressure reached 2235 psig, one of two Pressurizer Spray Valves began to dose as expected and the other valve traveled unexpectedly to the fully open position. The operators were unable to close the failed open valve.and manually tripped the reactor at 22:42 due to lowering RCS pressure. RCS pressure continued to lower below the safety injection (SI) actuation setpoint and an automatic SI occurred. All safety systems responded as expected and RCS pressure recovered to normal. The cause of the failed open valve was due to foreign material from the control air supply lodged in the positioner spool valve. The valve positioner and electro-pneumatic transmitter were replaced which returned the valve back into service. Planned corrective actions indude installing point of use filtration upstream of susceptible valve positioners or replace associated regulating valves to include a filter.

LERNJIIEER YEAR SEQUeITw.. 05000316 NUMBER 2020 -003 REV NO. -00 On September 4, 2020, Unit 2 was operating at 100 percent power. The Unit 2 control room operators were preparing to perform Main Turbine Stop and Control Valve [T AJM testing. At 16:06, the operators placed the initial set of Pressurizer Backup Heaters [PZR][EHTR] into service in preparation for a planned power reduction to support testing. After the heaters energized, the Pressurizer Spray Valve(s) [AB][FCV] 2-NRV-163 \"Reactor Coolant Loop '#3 to Pressurizer Spray Control Valve\" and 2-NRV-164 \"Reactor Coolant Loop #4 to Pressurizer Spray Control Valve\" were modulating to control pressurizer pressure. At 20:35, the operators began to lower reactor power in accordance with 2-OHP-4021-011-001, Attachment 2, Power Reductions Between 89 percent and 100 percent At 22:04, operators reported completing the planned power reduction and Unit 2 was stable at 92 percent reactor power. At 22:37, Pressurizer Spray Valves 2-NRV-163 and 2-NRV-164 closed together as expected in response to a lowering pressurizer pressure. At 22:38, both Pressurizer Spray Valves began to open upon a valid open signal. At 22:39, Reactor Coolant System (RCS) pressure reached 2235 psig and 2-NRV-163 began to close, as 2-NRV-164 continued to travel fully open. At 22:42, the control room received an annunciator, \"Pressurizer Pressure Low Deviation Backup Heaters On\" and discovered that 2-NRV-164 was fully open with zero percent demand. The operators entered procedure 2-0HP-4022-IFR-001, Instrument FaUure Response and determined that 2-NRV-164 could not be closed using control board or digital controls Alarm Log Panel controls. In accordance with procedure immediate actions, operators performed a manual trip of the Unit 2 Reactor [RCT]. The operators entered procedure 2-0HP-4023-E-O, Reactor Trip or Safety Injection. Reactor Coolant Pump(s) (RCP) [AB][P] 23 and 24 were removed from service following verification of E-0 immediate actions. Safety Injection (SI) automatically actuated after RCS pressure lowered below the setpoinl All automatic actions in response to the SI signal occurred as expected. Following the trip, Unit 2 was supplied by offsite power. AJI control rods fully inserted. The Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps [BA][P] started and operated, as expected. All Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) [BQ] components and Containment Isolation [8D] operated as required. Both Emergency Diesel Generators (EDG) [EK][DG] automatically started and remained in standby. Decay heat was removed by the Condenser Steam Dump Valves [SGJM and ECCS was secured.

NUMBER -003 REV NO. -00 During SI termination, RCP 22 was removed from service due to continued lowering RCS pressure caused by the failed open pressurizer spray valve 2-NRV-164. Afterward, RCS pressure recovered to normal pressure and remained stable. The event was reported via Event Notification 54885 in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(A), 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B), and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ivXA).

COMPONENT 2-NRV-164-PU, Reactor Coolant Loop #4 to Pressurizer Spray Control Valve 2-NRV-164 Pneumatic Positioner [AB][PC] CAUSE OF THE EVENT Pressurizer spray valve 2-NRV-164 failed open due to debris lodged In the positioner spool valve. No point of use filtration was installed upstream of the spray valve positioner to protect from debris generation downstream of the control air after filter [LF][FL l]. A Root Cause Evaluation (RCE) was in progress at the time this LER was submitted. Any additional insights or causes found to be substantively different as descnbed in this LER will be reported in a supplement at that time. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Completed Corrective Actions The valve positioner and electro-pneumatic transmitter for 2-NRV-164 was replaced. Satisfactory diagnostic testing of 2-NRV-164 was completed which returned the valve back into service. Planned Corrective Actions Install point of use control air filtration or associated regulating valve with a filter upstream of single point vulnerable valve positioners susceptible to binding caused by small particulate.

Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 2 05000316 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES NUCLEAR SAFETY YEAR 2020 SEQUENTIAL NUMBER -003 REV NO. -00 There was no actual nuclear safety hazards resulting from 2-NRV-164 failing open, as an safeguard features performed as expected. The potential nuclear safety significance and consequences could have been more severe had the operators not responded as they did or if any of the safety features had not functioned property. INDUSTRIAL SAFETY There was no actual or potential industrial safety hazard resulting from 2-NRV-164 failing open. RADIOLOGICAL SAFETY There was no actual or potential radiological safety hazard resulting from 2-NRV-164 failing open. PROBABILISTIC RISK ASSESSMENT A Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) was completed. The safety significance of the event was derived by calculating the Conditional Core Damage Probability (CCDP) and the Conditional Large Earty Release Probability (CLERP) of the transient initiating event, with the current site Full-Power Internal Events PRA Model of Record. The assessment concluded that the event was of very low safety significance.

The EDG\\ns did not \\nimmediately \\nenergize\\n their respective safety buses beca\\nuse offsite power remained available.  \\nHowever, approximately \\n14 minutes later, \\na loss of \\noffsite power\\n (LOOP)\\n occurred that resulted \\nin a reactor trip.  The output breakers for both EDGs automatically closed to reenergize the \\nsafety buses. \\n The licensee d\\neclared a\\nn Unusual Event.  All control rods successfully inserted.  \\nReactor inventory control was maintained by reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) and the \\nsafety relief valves (SRVs) were used to remove decay heat to the torus.\\n The high winds resulted in minor damage to \\nthe \\nreactor, turbine, and FLEX building\\ns, along with \\nmore severe damage to the nonsafety\\n-related cooling towers.  \\nThe licensee later determined \\nthat, although damaged, secondary containment remained functional thr\\noughout the event and \\nif challenged, would have prevented a radiological release to the environment.  However, when \\n\\ntested, the vacuum drawn in secondary containment by the standby gas treatment system was \\nslightly below the technical specification\\n (TS)\\n limit.\\n In addition, t\\nhe high winds result\\ned in increase\\nd debris loading to the essential service water \\n(ESW) system, which cause\\nd clogging of the train\\n ‚B™ strainer\\n and subsequent decrease of ESW \\nflow of 300\\n gpm to EDG\\n ‚B™\\n.  Operators successfully bypassed t\\nhe strainer\\n.  The train ‚A™ \\nstrainer was also challenged due to debris during the event; however, the differential pressure \\n\\nacross the strainer reached a maximum of 11\\n psid, which is below the limit of 15\\n psid and, \\ntherefore,\\n did not require to be bypassed\\n.  Although the operators declared\\n EDG ‚B™ \\ninoperable\\n according to TS, i\\nt did not experience any problems due to the use of unstrained ESW\\n and ran \\nsuccessfully through\\nout the event\\n.  Operators restored offsite power to the safety buses \\napproximately 25\\n hours after the LOOP \\noccurred\\n. This accident sequence precursor (ASP) analysis reveals that the most likely core damage \\nsequence is a \\nweather\\n-related \\nLOOP initiating event and the subsequent \\n(postulated) \\nfailure of \\nboth EDGs resulting in a station blackout \\n(SBO)\\n with the postulated failure\\ns of both \\nhigh\\n-pressure coolant injection (\\nHPCI\\n) and RCIC and \\nthe \\ninability of \\noperators \\nto \\nrecover alternating \\ncurrent (AC) \\npower \\nwithin 30\\n minutes\\n.  This accident seque\\nnce accounts for approximately \\n35 percent of the total conditional core damage probability (CCDP) for this event.\\n  Although the \\nLER 331\\n-2020-001   2 mean \\nCCDP \\nof \\n8×10\\n-4 for this event \\nwas high\\n, the risk \\nof core damage was mitigated\\n because \\ndefense\\n-in-depth and plant\\n-wide safet\\ny margins were maintained.\\n FLEX mitigation strategies were credited in this analysis\\n and significantly \\naffected the results.  \\nSpecifically, \\nwithout \\nthe mitigation capabilities of the \\nFLEX strategies \\nwould have \\nresult\\ned in a \\nCCDP approximately\\n a factor of \\n10 higher for \\nthis event\\n.  Throughout the review\\n of this event\\n, the analysis \\nassumptions and\\n results were systematically review\\ned to identify necessary \\nstandardized plant analysis risk (\\nSPAR) model changes \\nthat \\nwere \\nimplemented\\n to realisticall\\ny represent the event \\nand expected plant response.  In addition, \\nanalysis \\nresults were al\\nso use\\nd to identify key sources of uncertainty\\n. The risk of this event was significantly impacted by the \\nSBO scenarios. \\n The risk associated with \\nthe SBO scenarios is \\nparticularly high for this plant because\\n of having \\nonly two \\nsafety\\n-related \\nEDGs\\n and \\nthe in\\nability to crosstie safety\\n-related buses\\n from another unit\\n as Duane Arnold is a \\nsingle unit site\\n. 2 EVENT DETAILS \\n  2.1\\n Event Description\\n On August\\n 10, 2020, \\nsevere thunder\\nstorms and high winds caused a grid \\nperturbation that \\nresulted in an automatic start of both \\nEDGs.\\n  The EDG did not immediately \\nenergize\\n their \\nrespective safety buses because\\n offsite power remained available.

The train ‚A™ strainer was \\nalso challenged due to debris during the event; however, the differential pressure across the \\nstrainer reached a maximum of 11\\n psid, which is below the \\nlimit of 15\\n psid\\n and, therefore, did \\nnot require to be bypassed\\n.  Although the operators declared\\n EDG\\n ‚B™ \\ninoperable according to \\nTS, it\\n did not experience any problems due to the use of unstrained ESW\\n and ran successfully \\nthroughout the event\\n.  Operators \\nrestored offsite power to the safety buses approximately 25 \\nhours after the LOOP \\noccurred\\n.  Additional information is provided in \\nlicensee event report \\n(LER)\\n 331-2020-001-01, ﬁNotice of Unusua\\nl Event and Unit Trip Due to Loss of Offsite Power \\nDue to High Winds,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML20283A373)\\n. 2.2\\n Cause\\n The cause of the LOOP was a\\n severe storm (called a Derecho) with heavy rains and very high \\nwinds. \\n Wind speeds exceeded 80\\n mph for over 20\\n minutes with peak\\n winds on\\nsite \\nof \\ngreater \\nthan 100\\n mph. \\n The National Weather Service later estimated wind speed\\n peaks\\n were likely \\nLER 331\\n-2020-001   3 near 130\\n mph. \\n These \\nhigh\\n winds resulted in all six offsite power sources being damaged.  A \\nseparate offsite line \\nthat\\n powers \\nnon-essential plant loads was\\n also damaged.\\n 2.3\\n Sequence of \\nKey \\nEvents\\n Table\\n 1 provides the \\nsequence of \\nkey \\nevents\\n: Table \\n1.  Sequence of Key Events\\n August 10, 2020\\n 1138 Licensee entered abnormal operation procedures after a severe weather watch was issued\\n for the plant vicinity\\n; hourly checks\\n of the EDGs\\n were initiated and the licensee suspended \\nfuel movements\\n. 1235 Grid \\n\\n 1249 LOOP cause\\nd a main generator trip on reverse power automatic reactor scram.

The main steam isolation valves (MSIVs) remained open throughout the event.  During \\nmost LOOPs, the MSIVs will close due to the loss\\n of power from the reactor protection \\nsystem (RPS) motor generators.  However, the starting of the EDGs due to the grid \\n\\nperturbation prior to the LOOP allowed for a faster reenergization of the safety \\nbuses \\nprior\\n to the voltage from RPS motor generators \\ndecre\\nasing \\nbelow the value that would \\nresult in a loss of power to the MSIVs.  Because the MSIVs remained open, operators \\naligned the main steam line\\n (MSL)\\n drains\\n to the condenser\\n, which \\nminimized the number \\nof demands on the reactor \\nSRVs \\n(two SRVs each cycled \\nopen and closed one \\ntime\\n).  The current SPAR models use a failure\\n-to-close probability for SRVs of 9.6×10\\n-2 taken \\nfrom \\nNUREG\\n-1150, ﬁSevere Accident Risks: An Assessment for Five U.S. \\nNuclear \\nPower Plants\\n,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML120960691)\\n.  This probability \\naccounts for \\nmultiple SRV demands\\n; therefore, this probability was not changed given the two \\ndemands experienced during the event and the expected additional demands during a \\npostu\\nlated SBO in which the MSIVs would close.\\n  NUREG/CR\\n-7037, ﬁIndustry \\nPerformance of Relief Valves at U.S. Commercial Nuclear Power Plants through 2007,ﬂ\\n (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML110980205\\n) has an\\n updated reliability estimate; however, the \\nLER 331\\n-2020-001   4 adequacy of SRV testing that is included in these estimates has come into question.  \\nSpecifically, \\ntesting is \\nperformed \\nto demonstrate that the SRVs will open to relieve \\npressure during design\\n-basis accidents to \\nprevent overpressure of the reactor coolant \\nsystem.  However, the closing capability \\nof SRVs \\nis not tested \\nafter passing \\nsteam\\n.  In \\naddition, there \\nare\\n concerns about the demand data used in the stuck\\n-open SRV \\nprobability provided in \\nNUREG/CR\\n-7037.  The probability taken from \\nNUREG\\n-1150 is \\npotentially\\n conservative\\n; however, t\\nhe effect of the stuck\\n-open SRV probability on this \\nanaly\\nsis is largely mitigated by the credit of the di\\nesel\\n-driven firewater pump and FLEX \\nRPV makeup pumps for these scenarios\\n.  During the event, the running spent fuel pool (SFP) cooling pump ‚A™ tripped.  Operators \\nimmediately started SFP cooling pump ‚B™.\\n  Prior to the event, the licensee was loading fuel into a spent fuel canister. \\n These fuel \\nmoves were stopped prior to the storms affecting the site; the fuel and canister were \\nplace\\nd in a safe condition within the SFP.\\n  On August 12, a small \\ntear\\n was discov\\nered in the \\n5th floor wall of the r\\neactor \\nbuilding\\n that \\nwas the result of storm damage. \\n A subsequent \\ntest of the \\nsecondary \\ncontainment \\nboundary \\nidentified that the vacuum of \\n0.24 inches of water\\n was \\nless that the t\\nechnical \\nspecification \\nrequirement \\nof 0.25 inches of water. \\n At the time of discovery, the plant was\\n is in Mode 4, which does not require s\\necondary \\ncontainment \\nto be operable\\n.  However, \\nit \\nis very likely that \\nthe \\ntear\\n in the \\nreactor \\nbuilding wall likely existed \\nwhile the \\nplant wa\\ns in \\nMode 3\\n after the \\nreactor scram and, therefore, se\\ncondary \\ncontainment \\nwas inoperable \\nduring this period\\n.  Although considered inoperable, the licensee determined that a \\nvacuum of \\n0.24 inches of water was sufficient to \\nmaintain \\nthe safety function of \\nsecondary containment\\n. 3 MODELING \\n  3.1\\n Basis for ASP Analysis\\n The ASP Program performs independent analyses for initiating events.  ASP analyses of \\ninitiating events account for all failures/d\\negraded conditions and unavailabilities (e.g., equipment \\nout for maintenance) that occurred during the event, regardless of licensee performance.\\n1  Additional LERs were reviewed to determine if concurrent unavailabilities existed during the \\nAugust\\n 10th eve\\nnt.  No windowed events were identified.\\n The plant and licensee response to this event was evaluated by NRC inspectors \\nas \\ndocumented \\nin \\ninspection report 05000331/2020003\\n, ﬁDuane Arnold Energy Center \\nŒ Integrated Inspection \\nReport\\n 05000331/2020003 \\nand 07200032/2020001\\n,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML20314A150\\n).  \\nInspectors evaluated th\\ne licensee's immediate and follow\\n-up corrective\\n actions to this event. \\n The inspectors \\nalso \\ndetermined that all equipment\\n responded as expected with \\na few \\nexceptions\\n (e.g., \\nloss of spent fuel\\n pool cooling\\n), and operators followed appropriate\\n response \\nproce\\ndures. \\n The inspectors determined that the licensee's corrective actions to\\n address this \\ncomplex event were appropriate to the circumstances and commensurate with\\n the potential \\nsafety significance.\\n  No findings or violations of more than minor significance\\n were identified.\\n  1  ASP analyses also account for any degraded condition(s) that were identified after the initiating event occurred if\\n the failure/degradation exposure \\ntime\\n(s) overlapped the initiating event date.\\n LER 331\\n-2020-001   5 3.2\\n Analysis Type\\n An initiating event analysis \\nwas performed using \\nRevision\\n 8.56\\n of the \\nSPAR model for \\nDuane \\nArnold Energy Center\\n created \\nin June\\n 2019.  This event was modeled as a \\nweather\\n-related\\n LOOP initiating event.\\n 3.3\\n SPAR Model \\nModifications\\n The following modifications were required for this initiating event analysis:\\n  Crediting FLEX Strategies\\n.  The probability of basic event FLX\\n-XHE\\n-XE-ELAP \\n(operators fail to declare ELAP when beneficial\\n) was set to its nominal value of 10\\n-2 to \\nactivate the credit for FLEX mitigation strategies for postulated SBO scenarios for which \\nan extended loss of AC power (ELAP) is declared.\\n2  FLEX Reliability Parameters\\n.  FLEX \\nhardware reliability \\nparameters suitable for inclusion \\nin the NRC SPAR models \\nis \\nnot yet\\n available.  Therefore, \\nthe \\nbase \\nSPAR model\\ns currently \\nuse the reliability\\n parameters\\n of permanently installed equipment\\n, which is\\n inconsistent with the limited experience with \\nthe operation of \\nFLEX\\n equipment\\n.  As part \\nof \\nan NRC audit \\nperformed \\nof p\\nreliminary FLEX \\nhardware data provided by the \\nPressurized Water Reactor Owner™s Group (PWROG)\\n, Idaho National Laboratory\\n reviewed the FLEX hardware parameter\\ns estimated by the PWROG\\n.  This review \\nrevealed that \\nFLEX diesel generator failure\\n-to-start\\n (FTS)\\n probability \\nis 3 to 10\\n times \\nhigher\\n and failure\\n-to-run\\n (FTR)\\n rate is \\n2 to 5\\n times \\nhigher than permanently installed \\nEDGs\\n.  The portable \\nengine\\n-driven\\n centrifugal pump FTS\\n probability\\n is \\nat least \\n8 times \\nhigher\\n and FTR rate \\nis \\nat least \\n6 times \\nhigher than permanently installed pumps\\n.  See \\nTable\\n 1 in \\nINL/EXT\\n-20-58327\\n, ﬁEvaluation of Weakly Informed Priors for FLEX Data\\n,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML20155K834)\\n for addition\\nal information.\\n  Therefore, t\\no provide \\na more representative\\n estimate of the FLEX \\nhardware r\\neliability\\n parameters, this \\nanalysi\\ns increased the hardware reliability \\nby a \\nfactor of \\nthree \\nin the best estimate case\\n.  The use of th\\ne FLEX hardware \\nmultiplier\\n is a key \\nmodeling\\n uncertainty\\n and is evaluated \\nfurther \\nin Section 4.3\\n.  Removal of EDG Repair Credit for ELAP Scenarios\\n.

However, this potential \\ncredit is not applicable for scenarios where ELAP will be declared because (a.) operators \\n\\nwill be focused on implementing the FLEX mitigation strategies and (b.) the DC load \\nshedding activities could preclude recovery of EDG\\ns.  Therefore, credit for EDG repair \\ncredit was removed from the sequences if it is included after ELAP is likely declared \\n\\n(i.e.,\\n 1 hour)\\n via a change set containing the applicable EDG repair basic events\\n.  HPCI Credit\\n During ELAP Scenarios.\\n  The \\nbase SPAR model does not credit FLEX for \\nscenarios where RCIC is failed, but HPCI \\nis available\\n.  This assumption is likely \\nconservative and, therefore, \\nFLEX \\ncredit was\\n applied \\nby \\nmodifying the SBO event tree \\nby transferring the\\n SBO Sequence\\n 6 to the SBO ELAP event tree (see Figure\\n A-2 in \\nAppendix\\n A).  Most of the\\n FLEX information\\n available\\n, including \\nthermal\\n-hydraulic \\ncalcu\\nlations\\n, is focused on RCIC\\n performance and do\\nes not consider HPCI as an \\n 2  After the \\nDerecho storm had passed\\n the site, the licensee had the capability to pre\\n-stage FLEX equipment.  \\nHowever, after \\ndiscussing this possibility, the decision was made to\\n not move any \\nFLEX equipment.\\n LER 331\\n-2020-001   6 alternative high\\n-pressure injection source.\\n  Therefore, this \\nchange\\n is potentially \\nnonconservative.\\n  SBO-ELAP Event Tree Modification\\n.  The SBO\\n-ELAP event tree was modified to include \\nthe query of containment venting in scenarios when reactor depressurization fails.  \\nThe \\nmodified SBO\\n-ELAP event tree is provided in\\n Figure B\\n-1 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  Additional Mitigat\\nion Credit for Stuck\\n-Open SRV Scenarios\\n.  MELCOR calculations were \\nperformed to determine timing information \\nfor postulated stuck\\n-open SRV scenarios.  \\nSpecifically, the\\n time until RCIC/HPCI\\n isolation on low steam pressure (75 psig) and \\ntimes to core uncovery/damage\\n were calculated\\n.  Based on these calculations, the \\nRCIC \\nor HPCI would isolate on low steam pressure \\nin approximately 90\\n minutes given a single \\nstuck\\n-open SRV.  Core damage \\nis estim\\nated to occur \\nbetween\\n 4Œ6 hours.\\n  For \\ntwo \\nstuck\\n-open SRVs, \\nRCIC\\n/HPCI\\n would isolate in less than 1\\n hour and core d\\namage would \\noccur \\nin \\napproximately \\n90 minutes.  \\nDiscussions with the licensee revealed\\n that \\noperators\\n would have \\nenough\\n time to connect and initiate either firewater or FLEX \\nreactor \\npressure vessel (RPV) \\nmakeup\\n, which is not credited in the base SPAR model.  \\nTo provide this \\ncredit\\n, the \\napplicable sequences \\nwere transferred to the SBO\\n-ELAP \\nevent tree.\\n  In addition, offsite power recovery times for the SBO\\n-1 and SBO\\n-2 event \\ntrees were changed to \\n3 hours and 1\\n hour, respectively\\n, based on MELCOR calculation \\nestimates.\\n3  These modified event trees are provide\\nd in Figure\\ns B-2 and B\\n-3 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  72-Hour AC Power Recovery Requirement\\n.  The base SPAR model requires AC power \\nrecovery within 72\\n hours \\nfor a safe/stable end state for ELAP scenarios with successful \\nFLEX implementation.  If AC power is not recovered \\nin these scenarios, the SPAR \\nmodels assume core damage.  The American Society of Mechanical \\nEngineers/American Nuclear Society (ASME/ANS) probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) \\nstandard definition for safe/stable end state does not require AC power recovery. \\n Because of the large uncertainty in modeling assumptions related to availability and \\nreliability of components and strategies for mission times that are well beyond 24\\n hours \\nand the unclear basis for requiring AC power recovery within 72\\n hours, the 72\\n-hour AC \\npower requirement was eliminated in this analysis by inserting a new basic event, OPR\\n-72HR\\n-OFF (\\nno 72-hr OPR requirement\\n), under the top event in the OPR\\n-72H fault tree \\nand setting it to FALSE.  This change is considered a key modeling uncertainty for\\n this \\nanalysis.  This modified fault tree is provided in Figure\\n B-4 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  As part of this \\nchange, the FTR events for FLEX diesel generators and pumps have a 72\\n-hour mission \\ntime in the base SPAR model.  These mission \\ntimes were reset to be consistent with the \\n24-hour mission time used in the SPAR model.\\n  Credit for \\nTechnical Support Center (TSC) Diesel Generator\\n.  The SBO\\n-ELAP event tree \\ncurrent\\nly credits \\nthe \\nFLEX \\n480-volt (V) diesel generators\\n in the FLEX\\n-480 fault tree.  \\nHowever, \\nthe plant has \\nan additional \\nTSC diesel generator that can al\\nso charge the \\nsafety\\n-related batteries\\n.  Therefore, the FLEX\\n-480 fault tree was modified by inserting \\nthe existing\\n DG-TSC\\n fault tree and changing the existing gate structure\\n to ensure both \\nthe FLEX and TSC diesel generators a\\nre \\npotentially \\navailable to provide \\nbattery \\ncharging\\n.  The two human failure events (HFEs)\\n FLX\\n-XHE\\n-XM-480 (\\noperators fail to \\n 3  The associated \\nEDG repair times were also changed.  \\nHowever, this change does not affect this analysis\\n because EDG repair is not credited after ELAP is declared.\\n LER 331\\n-2020-001   7 stage or run or load or refuel 480V portable flex diesel\\n) and\\n EPS-XHE\\n-XM-TSC \\n(operator action to align TSC DG to battery chargers\\n) are treated as completely \\ndependent in the SPAR model post\\n-processing rules\\n.  This modified fault tree is \\nprovided in Figure\\n B-5 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  Credit for Firewater\\n Pump\\n.  The SBO\\n-ELAP event tree current\\nly credits FLEX RPV \\nmakeup\\n in the FLEX\\n-RPV fault tree.  However, \\nfirewater is not currently credited.\\n  Therefore, the \\nFLEX\\n-RPV fault tree \\nwas modified by inserting \\nthe \\nexisting \\nFWS fault tree\\n and changing the existing gate structure \\nto ensure both\\n firewater and the FLEX RPV \\nmakeup pumps are available to provide reactor inventory makeup.  \\nIn the FWS \\nfault \\ntree, t\\nhe human error probability (HEP) for existing \\nHFE FWS\\n-XHE\\n-XM-ERRLT \\n(operator fails \\nto align firewater injection\\n) was set to a screening value\\n 0.1\\n.4  In addition, \\nFWS\\n-XHE\\n-XM-ERRLT\\n and existing basic event FWS\\n-EDP\\n-TM1P49 (\\ndiesel fire pump is \\nunavailable because of maintenance\\n) were \\nmoved under a new ‚AND™ gate because the \\nfirewater pump \\nwas undergoing maintenance \\nat the onset of the event; however, \\noperators could clear the maintenance tags to restore the pump within 1 hour, if needed\\n.  The two HFEs \\nFWS\\n-XHE\\n-XM-ERRLT and \\nFLX-XHE\\n-XM-RPV\\n (operators fail to stage or \\nrun or supply or refill FLEX RPV pump\\n) are treated as completely dependent in the \\nSPAR model post\\n-processing rules.  \\nThis modified fault tree\\ns are\\n provided in \\nFigure\\ns B-6 and B-7 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  Use of Environmental Common\\n-Cause\\n Failure (CCF)\\n Parameters for ESW Strainers\\n.  To \\nimprove \\nthe realism in the \\nmodel\\ning of\\n potential \\nCCF\\n of the \\nESW \\nstrainers due to the \\nincreased debris loading experienced during the event,\\n the alpha factors for ESW \\nstrainers were modified to those of environmental events (instead of all causes)\\n, which \\nare more representative \\nof the conditions experienced during the event\\n.  Specifically,\\n the \\nalpha factors ZA\\n-STR\\n-PG-SWS\\n-02A01 \\n(alpha factor 1 \\nin group size 2 for component \\nSTR with failure mode PG:SWS\\n) and ZA\\n-STR\\n-PG-SWS\\n-02A02 (\\nalpha factor 2 in group \\nsize 2 for component STR with failure mode PG:SWS\\n) were changed from their nominal \\nvalues to 0.874 and 0.126,\\n respectively\\n.5  Credit for Ability to \\nBypass Clogged ESW Strainers\\n.  The ability for operators to bypass \\nthe clogged ESW strainers\\n is not included in the base SPAR model.  To provide this \\ncredit\\n, new fault trees ESW\\n-STRAINER\\n-A (ESW pump A discharge strainer plugs\\n) and \\nESW STRAINER\\n-B (ESW pump \\nA discharge strainer plugs\\n) were created\\n.  These two \\nnew fault trees include the existing strainer independent failure and CCF basic events \\nalong with new \\nHFE\\n ESW\\n-XHE\\n-XM-BYPASS (\\noperators fail to bypass plugged strainer\\n), \\nwhich credits the ability of operators to bypass a clogged ESW strainer.  \\nThese new fault \\ntrees are provided in Figures\\n B-6 and B\\n-7 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  ESW-XHE\\n-XM-BYPASS was \\nevaluated using \\nNUREG/CR\\n-6883, ﬁThe SPAR H Human Reliability Analysis Method,ﬂ \\n(ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML051950061).  The HEP for ESW\\n-XHE\\n-XM-BYPASS was \\ncalculated to be 1×10\\n-3; see Appendix\\n C for additional information\\n.  Fault tree ESW\\n-STRAINER\\n-A was inserted as a transfer tree in fault trees ESW\\n-A and ESW\\n-DGN\\n-A to \\nsubstitute for the existing strainer independent failure and CCF basic events.  Likewise, \\n 4  NUREG\\n-1792, ﬁGood Practices for Implementing Human Reliability \\nAnalysis,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession \\nNo.\\n ML051160213) provides that 0.1 is an appropriate screening (i.e., typically conservative) value for most post\\n-initiator HFEs.\\n 5  These alpha factor changes also affect the residual heat removal (RHR) service water heat syste\\nm strainers.  \\nThe RHR service water system takes its suction of the same pit as ESW.\\n LER 331\\n-2020-001   8 fault tree ESW\\n-STRAINER\\n-B was inserted in fault trees ESW\\n-B and ESW\\n-DGN\\n-B.  \\nThese modified \\nfault\\n trees are provided in Figures\\n B-8 through B\\n-13 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  Reactor Water Level Control During \\na LOOP\\n.  The existing \\nHFEs for reactor water level \\ncontrol using RCIC (\\nRCI-XHE\\n-XO-ERROR, \\nRCI-XHE\\n-XM-OPERATE\\n, RCI\\n-XHE\\n-XM-OPERATE2\\n) and/or HPCI (\\nHCI-XHE\\n-XO-ERROR, \\nHCI-XHE\\n-XO-ERROR1\\n) were not \\nevaluated \\nto \\naccount for the \\nprocedures directing operators to bypass the \\nhigh\\n reactor \\nwater level (Level 8) pump \\ntrips\\n, raise reactor wat\\ner level\\n, and control level in a\\n relatively \\nnarrow (\\n10-inch\\n) band when \\nforced circulation is lost\\n.  With the pump trips bypas\\nsed, a \\nfailure to control level could result in flooding the pump turbines \\nresulting in a loss of \\nboth high\\n-pressure injection systems\\n.  To better represent this action, a new ba\\nsic event \\nRCS-XHE\\n-XM-LEVEL (\\noperators fail to control reactor water level duri\\nng loss of forced \\ncirculation\\n) was inserted in the applicable fault trees\\n (HCI, HCI01, HCI02, RCI, RCI01, \\nRCI02, FLX\\n-TDP, FLX\\n-TDP\\n2) to replace the existing HFEs\\n for \\nLOOP scenarios\\n.  The HFE RCS\\n-XHE\\n-XM-LEVEL was evaluated using IDHEAS\\n-ECA methodology because \\nthe performance shaping factors \\n(PSF\\ns) of \\nthe \\nSPAR\\n-H method \\ndo not represent control \\nactions very well.\\n  The HEP for \\nRCS-XHE\\n-XM-LEVEL\\n was calculated to be \\n2×10\\n-2; see \\nAppendix\\n C for additional informati\\non.  SPAR Model Quantification Issues\\n.  A review of preliminary analysis results identified \\nsome \\nSPAR model quantifications issues that required \\nchanges.  First, t\\nhe component \\nID was deleted from basic event FWS\\n-EDP\\n-TM-1P49 (\\ndiesel fire pump is \\nunavailable \\nbecause of maintenance\\n) because it was causing calculation errors.\\n  Second, \\nsome \\nevent tree linkage rules were added to the SBO event tree. \\n These rules substituted in \\ninitiator specific \\npower recovery logic to facilitate more accurate calculat\\nion of success \\npath cut sets.\\n 3.4\\n Analysis\\n Assumptions\\n The following modeling assumptions were \\nrequired to reflect the plant status and event \\ncircumstances \\nfor\\n this initiating event assessment\\n:  The probability of IE\\n-LOOP\\nWR (loss of offsite power (\\nweather\\n-related\\n)) was set to 1.0 \\ndue to the loss of offsite power. \\n All other initiating event probabilities were set to zero.\\n  Basic event ESW\\n-STR\\n-PG-PDISB (\\nESW pump B discharge strainer 1S\\n-89B plugs\\n) was \\nset to TRUE due to ESW train ‚B™ strainer becoming \\nclogged during the event.\\n  Basic event FWS\\n-EDP\\n-TM-1P49\\n was set to \\nTRUE\\n because th\\ne pump was undergoing \\nmaintenance during the event.  All other test and maintenance probabilities were kept at \\ntheir nominal values.\\n  Offsite power was recovered to \\nthe \\nsafety buses approximately 25 hours after the LOOP \\noccurred\\n.  Based\\n on the event information and \\ndiscussions with \\nRegion\\n 3 inspectors, \\nit \\nwas determined that offsite\\n power could have been restored \\nto the safety buses \\nshortly \\nafter the\\n Vinton offsite power line was restor\\ned approximately 23 hours \\nafter\\n the LOOP \\noccurred\\n.  Therefore, basic events OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR30M\\nWR (operators fail to recover \\noffsite power in 30 minutes\\n), OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR01HWR (\\noperators fail to recover offsite \\npower in 1 hour\\n), OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR05HWR (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in 5 \\nhours\\n), OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR08HWR (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in 8 hours\\n), \\nOEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR10HWR (\\noperators fail to\\n recover offsite power in 10 hours\\n), \\nand \\nOEP\\n-LER 331\\n-2020-001   9 XHE\\n-XL-NR012HWR (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in 12 hours\\n) were set \\nTRUE.\\n  The HEP for b\\nasic event \\nOEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR024HWR (\\noperators fail to recover \\noffsite power in 24 hours\\n) was \\ncalculated\\n to be 2×10\\n-3; see \\nAppendix\\n C for additional \\ninformation\\n.  Both\\n control rod drive (CRD) pumps were impacted by using the \\nMSL\\n drains to the \\ncondenser for cooldown.  The operating CRD pump developed a seal leak\\n and was \\nsecured\\n.  In addition, operators manually started the standby pump\\n when \\nit became \\nvapor bound \\ndue to \\nthe \\nhigh \\nsuction \\nwater \\ntemperature.\\n  Therefore, basic events \\nCRD-MDP\\n-FR-A (CRD pump A fails to run\\n) and CRD\\n-MDP\\n-FS-B (CRD pump B fails to start\\n) were set to TRUE.\\n  This modeling assumption is potentially conservative; however, the \\nnonrecoverable failure of the CRD system results in negligible risk contribution for th\\nis \\nanalysis.\\n 4 ANALYSIS RESULTS \\n  4.1\\n Preliminary \\nResults\\n The mean\\n CCDP for this analysis is \\npreliminarily \\ncalculated to be \\n8×10\\n-4.  The ASP Program \\nthreshold for initiating events is a CCDP of 10\\n-6 or the \\nplant\\n-specific \\nCCDP of an uncomplicated \\nreactor trip \\nwith a non\\n-recoverable loss of feed water or the condenser heat sink, whichever is \\ngreater.

The results of any sensitivity \\nanalyses \\nperformed to \\nevaluate these uncertainties are provided in \\nTable\\n 4.  The Amount of Credit for \\nFLEX \\nMitigation Strategies\\n.  The credit\\ning of FLEX mitigation \\nstrategies has as significant impact on these analysis results\\n.  A sensitivity analysis \\nyields \\nan increase in \\nCCDP\\n of \\napproximately a factor of 10\\n with\\nout\\n FLEX credit.\\n  While \\ncredit is appropriate, it is important to note that th\\nere \\nare considerable un\\ncertainties\\n (as \\ndiscussed below)\\n associated with \\nvarious aspects of \\nFLEX modeling.\\n  HPCI Credit During ELAP Scenarios.\\n  The base SPAR model does not credit FLEX for \\nscenarios where RCIC is failed, but HPCI \\nis available.  This assumption is likely \\nconservative and, therefore, FLEX credit was applied by modifying the SBO event tree\\n.  Most of the FLEX information available, \\nincluding thermal\\n-hydraulic calcu\\nlations, is \\nfocused on RCIC performance and does not consider HPCI as an alternative high\\n-pressure injection source.  \\nBecause \\nthe use of\\n FLEX \\nin scenarios that only HPCI is \\navailable has not been analyzed, \\ncrediting \\nFLEX in\\n such \\nscenarios may\\n be unrealistic \\nand may \\noverestimate\\n the \\nrisk re\\nduction \\nachieved by crediting FLEX\\n.  A sensitivity \\nanalysi\\ns yields a\\nn increase in \\nCCDP of \\napproximately \\n120 percent \\nwithout FLEX credit\\n for scenarios where HPCI is successful and RCIC is un\\navailable/failed\\n.  FLEX Hardware Reliability\\n.  As previously mentioned, \\nhardware reliabilit\\nies\\n for FLEX \\nequipment \\nare\\n not \\ncurrently available and, therefore, the SPAR model uses the reliability \\nof permanently installed equipment\\n, which is \\nconsidered nonconservative\\n.  Based on \\npreliminary data received from the PWROG, failure probabilities and rates for FLEX \\ndiesel generators and engine\\n-driven centrifugal pump\\ns are \\n2 to \\n10 times \\nmore \\nlikely to \\nfail \\nthan \\npermanently installed \\nequipment\\n.  Ther\\nefore, \\nsensitivity analyses were \\nperformed using the multiplier range \\nof 2 to 10 times that of permanently installed \\nequipment\\n.  These sensitivity \\nanalyses yield a decrease in CCDP of \\n3 percent for a \\nmultiplier of 2 and an increase in CCDP of approximately\\n 18 percent \\nand\\n 57 percent\\n for \\nmultipliers of 5 and 10\\n, respectively\\n. LER 331\\n-2020-001   11  FLEX Human Reliability\\n.  D\\netailed human reliability analysis was not performed for FLEX \\nmitigation strategies\\n for the SPAR models\\n.  Placeholder values for the HEPs that were \\njudged to \\nbe reasonable by model developers are currently used.\\n  A re\\nview of these \\nHEPs did not identify any \\nsignificant \\nissues\\n and are judged to be reasonable for this \\nanalysis\\n.  Future HRA \\nof these actions will likely result in\\n HEP\\n increases for some \\nHFEs \\nand decr\\neases\\n for others\\n.  Sensitivity analys\\nis increasing and decreasing these HEPs by \\na factor of 5 results in an increase in CCDP of \\n135\\n percent and decrease in CCDP\\n of \\n27 percent, respectively\\n.  72-Hour AC Power Recovery Requirement\\n.  Th\\nis analysis eliminated t\\nhe 72\\n-hour AC \\npower recovery credit\\n for ELAP scenarios with successful implementation of the re\\nquired \\nFLEX mitigation strategies.  \\nRequiring AC power recovery within 72\\n hours as originally \\nincluded in the SPAR model \\nresults in an approximately \\n34 percent\\n increase in CCDP \\nwithout a clear technical basis.\\n7  Potential \\nEffect\\ns of \\nBypassing ESW \\nStrainer\\n.  During the event, operators successfully \\nbypassed ESW train ‚B™ strainer\\n and EDG ‚B™ \\nsuccessfully \\nran throughout the event \\n(greater than 24\\n hours)\\n.  Operators monitored EDG ‚B™ parameters and did not identify \\nperformance \\nissues \\nwith \\nthe reduce \\nESW flowrate reduced by 300 gpm.\\n  However, \\ncooling the EDG ‚B™ with the strainer bypassed would result in an unknown decrease \\nin \\nreliability due to increase f\\nouling/plugging potential with the EDG ‚B™ coolers.  \\nA sensitivity case with \\nthe EDG ‚B™ \\nFTR probability doubled \\nresults in a\\nn inc\\nrease in\\n CCDP \\nof \\napproximately\\n 89 percent\\n.

An \\nauxiliary operator (AO) was sent in accordance with the \\n\\nalarm response procedure. When the operator arrived, the \\nESW train ‚B™ strainer differential pressure reached 15\\n psid \\nand was directed by the main control room operators to \\nbypass the strainer. This was completed within 15\\n minutes. \\nTherefore, the nominal t\\nime for this HFE is assumed to be \\n5 minutes for diagnosis and 10\\n minutes for action.\\n  Although ESW train ‚B™ flow to its respective EDG had \\ndecreased dropped from 1100 to 800\\n gpm, operators did not \\nobserve any degradation in EDG ‚B™ performance. It is \\nbeli\\neved that strainer debris loading peaked at this level (as \\nindicated by the ESW train ‚A™ not increasing after reaching \\n11 psid even though its strainer was not bypassed). It is \\npossible that EDG ‚B™ would have continued to run \\nsatisfactorily with the plug\\nged strainer with a differential \\npressure of 15\\n psid. For this event assessment, it is assumed \\nthat operators would have approximately 1\\n hour to bypass \\nthe strainer, which is could be potential conservative.

All\\n comments \\nfrom the \\nNextEra\\n, NRR, and \\nRegion 3 are \\nprovided either verbatim or \\nsummarized below.  \\nIn addition, t\\nhe Office of Nuclear \\nRegulatory Research (RES) response is provided for the applicable comments.\\n D.1\\n Comments not Requiring Response or Change\\n  NRR, Section 3.3:\\n We believe increasing the hardware\\n failure rate by a factor of three using \\ninsights from INL/EXT\\n-20-58327 was reasonable although potentially non\\n-conservative \\nconsidering some of the failure rates for certain equipment could be even higher.\\n  NRR, Section 3.3:\\n We noted that the analysis cred\\nited HPCI during ELAP scenarios, even \\nthough most Final Integrated Plans (FIPs) only discuss crediting RCIC only and the SPAR \\nmodels only credit RCIC.  We understand that the decision to credit HPCI averted undue \\nconservatism.  The decision to credit HPCI \\nwas researched and even informed by \\nthermal\\n-hydraulic analysis.  We believe this approach to increase realism of the PRA \\nanalysis is a strength.\\n  NRR, Section 3.3:\\n We noted that the analysis adjusted the portable FLEX equipment to a \\n24-hour mission time to \\nestimate \\nFTR probability. \\n While we understand a 72\\n-hour mission \\ntime would be overly conservative, would a 24\\n-hour mission time be potentially non\\n-conservative? \\n However, since the analysis has identified failure probabilities of FLEX \\nequipment as a key u\\nncertainty and performed appropriate sensitivity analysis, we do not \\nconsider this observation as a substantive comment.\\n  NRR, Section 4.1:\\n The use of a mean value rather than a point estimate is acceptable and \\nsupported by references such as NUREG\\n-1489, an\\nd NUREG\\n-1855.\\n D.2\\n Comments Requiring Response or Change\\n  Region 3, Executive Summary:\\n The \\nExecutive Summary\\n states the following\\n: ﬁAlthough \\nthe preliminary mean CCDP of 1\\n×10-3 for this event currently meets the criterion for a \\nsignificant precursor, the risk to the public remained very low because defense in depth and \\nplant\\n-wide safety margins were maintained.ﬂ  This sentence is simultaneously describing the \\nrisk as both high a\\nnd low.  In the interest of clarity and consistency of our message about \\nthe high safety significance of this issue, consider changing the wording.  One possible \\nalternative would be: ﬁthe risk of core damage was mitigated because defense in depth and \\nplan\\nt-wide safety margins were maintained.ﬂ\\n RES Response/Action:\\n The suggested change \\nwas\\n implemented in the final report\\n.

Recall that the \\n‚B™ train \\nESW \\nstrainer reached 15\\n psid and required bypassing due to debri\\ns loading. \\n The ‚A™ train strainer reached 11\\n psid and did not require bypassing but represented a potential \\nchallenge or a ﬁnear miss.ﬂ  This challenge to both trains of \\nESW \\nis one of the main drivers \\nof the high \\nCCDP \\nand the reason that the LIC\\n-504 effor\\nt was started.  Consider adding \\nthese insights in the \\nExecutive Summary\\n and the \\nEvent Description\\n that describes how both \\nservice water \\ntrains were simultaneously \\naffected\\n.  This would have the benefit of\\n  (a.)\\n increas\\ning\\n transparency for those reading the ASP analysis and \\n(b) provide a better \\ntechnical basis for adjustment of the \\ncommon\\n-cause failure alpha factors described in \\nSection\\n 3.3\\n. RES Response/Action:\\n A description of the challenge to the train ‚A™ ESW strainer \\nwas\\n added to the \\nExecutive Summary\\n and \\nSection 2.1\\n of the final report\\n.  Region 3, \\nExecutive Summary and Section 2.1\\n: Considered changing the following \\nsentence: ﬁThe licensee later determined that damage to the reactor building resulted in the \\nsecondary containment being inoperable according to TS due to i\\nnsufficient vacuum.ﬂ  \\nSuggested replacement: ﬁThe licensee later determined that, although damaged, secondary \\n\\ncontainment remained functional throughout the event and if challenged, would have \\nprevented a radiological release to the environment.  However, \\nwhen tested, the vacuum \\n\\ndrawn in secondary containment by the standby gas treatment system was slightly below \\nthe very conservative technical specification limit.ﬂ\\n RES Response/Action:\\n The suggested change \\nwas\\n implemented in the final report\\n.  Region 3, \\nSection 2.1\\n: The control rod drive (\\nCRD\\n) pumps were impacted by using the \\nmain steam line drains to the condenser for cooldown.  The operating CRD pump developed \\n\\na seal leak.  The standby pump was started, and th\\ne pump became vapor bound due to the \\nhigh temperature at the suction of the pump.  Consider whether the report should discuss \\nthis impact and model as appropriate given that CRD is a BWR alternate injection source for \\nlate injection.  While this condition \\nwould not impact the current dominant sequences, it \\ncould impact other LOOP core damage sequences.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n The degradation of both CRD pumps \\nwas\\n modeled explicitly in the \\nanalysis and documented in the final report (\\nSection\\n 3.4\\n).  Note that this change has a \\nnegligible effect on the result because four additional systems (ESW, residual heat removal \\n\\nservice water, firewater, and general service water) are credited for late injection during a \\nLOOP.\\n  Region \\n3, \\nSection 2.\\n2: Consider deleting the following sentence:\\n ﬁThe event was not \\nconsidered a beyond design basis eventﬂ.  It is not relevant to the risk analysis of the event.  \\nSimilarly delete the point about winds being within the limits of a design basis t\\nornado.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n These two sentences \\nwere\\n deleted in the final report.\\n LER 331\\n-2020-001   D-3  Region 3, Section 3.1:\\n Consider delet\\ning the following sentence:\\n ﬁThe assessment did not \\nidentify any loss of the plant™s three fission product barriers or the key safety functions \\nsupporting themﬂ.  The report accurately captures the plant impacts necessary for modeling \\nthe risk significance of the event.\\n RES Response\\n/Action:\\n The sentence \\nwas\\n deleted in the final report.\\n  NRR, Section 3.3:\\n We recommend not referring to NEI 16\\n-06 to justify FLEX failure \\nprobability multipliers since the screening values provided in NEI 16\\n-06 were generated prior \\nto evaluating any specifi\\nc FLEX failure rate data.  Sufficient explanation and justification of \\nadjusting FLEX hardware reliability was provided with the discussion of INL/EXT\\n-20-58327, \\nwhich used actual (albeit) limited operating experience.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n The applicable te\\nxt, including the corresponding footnote, \\nwas\\n deleted in the final report.\\n  Region 3, Section 3.\\n3: Consider changing the language to footnote #2.  As it is currently \\nwritten, the sentence is not factually correct.  After the Derecho storm had passed the sit\\ne, \\nthe licensee had the capability and flexibility to pre\\n-stage the FLEX equipment.  On the day \\nof the event, after the Derecho had passed, the licensee appropriately debated whether to \\nposition FLEX emergency diesel generators.  One of the two in\\n-plant ED\\nG had been \\ndeclared inoperable but ultimately the licensee made the decision not to pre\\n-position FLEX \\nequipment.  It should not be implied that the licensee was bound by procedural constraints \\n\\nthat did not exist.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n The footnote \\nwas\\n revis\\ned as ﬁ\\nAfter the Derecho storm had passed \\nthe site, the licensee had the capability to pre\\n-stage FLEX equipment.  However, after \\ndiscussing this possibility, the decision was made to not move any FLEX equipment\\n.ﬂ  NRR, Section 3.3:\\n We noted that the analysi\\ns adjusted the portable FLEX equipment to a \\n24-hour mission time to estimate \\nFTR probability. \\n While we understand a 72\\n-hour mission \\ntime would be overly conservative, would a 24\\n-hour mission time be potentially non\\n-conservative? \\n However, since the analysis has identified failure probabilities of FLEX \\nequipment as a key uncertainty and performed appropriate sensitivity analysis, we do not \\n\\nconsider this observation as a substantive\\n comment.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n We believe that\\n if the applicable FLEX strategies are fulfilling their \\nsafety function at 24\\n-hours, we believe that is sufficient to declare safe/stable end state.\\n  NRR, \\nSection 3.3:\\n We understand the decision to remove the cr\\nedit for EDG repair during \\nELAP scenarios.  Our comment would be that this is appropriate to do on a case\\n-by-case \\nbasis, it would be useful to show a sensitivity showing how much of an effect this had on the \\nresults.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n A sensitivity case\\n crediting\\n EDG repair for ELAP scenario \\nestimates a mean CCDP \\n6×10-4 (a decrease of approximately \\n20 percent).  \\nThe issue of \\ncrediting EDG repair in the base SPAR models could be reconsidered.  \\nIt is\\n a typical SPAR \\nmodel practice to not credit strategies n\\not included in the licensee PRAs\\n, yet less than a \\nthird \\nof licensee PRAs include credit for EDG repair\\n.  In addition\\n, the nonrecovery \\nprobabilities are calculated by INL using data extracted from unplanned unavailability times \\nfrom MSPI (typically normal operations with only a single EDG to troubleshoot).  During the \\nLER 331\\n-2020-001   D-4 Level 3 PRA project, industry peer review members questi\\noned the basis for crediting repair \\nof the EDGs, which had been adopted from the SPAR models.  Subsequently, it was \\ndecided to remove EDG repair from the Level 3 PRA because the staff questioned whether \\nrepair data collected under normal conditions is appl\\nicable to SBO scenarios where \\nconditions may be different (e.g., reduce\\nd lighting, increased stress, staffing constraints) and \\nthere would be multiple EDG failures to troubleshoot.  Although there could also be factors \\n(e.g., increased priority, eliminatio\\nn of restrictive licensee processes) that reduce the repair \\ntime.\\n  NextEra, Section 3.4:\\n The preliminary \\nASP analysis \\nused the timeline that was developed \\nfor the \\nLER\\n to note that power was not restored to the safety buses from an offsite power \\nsource until\\n twenty\\n-five hours after the LOOP occurred1. \\n However, the Vinton 161\\n-kV line \\nwas restored as a power source at 11:26. \\n As the plant was in a safe and stable \\nconfiguration the ensuing period was taken up with coordinating a deliberate and \\nuninterrupted tra\\nnsfer of power from the \\nEDGs\\n to the offsite power supply. \\n Had an \\nEDG\\n failed at any point after 11:26, offsite power was available to re\\n-energize emergency busses. \\nTherefore, offsite power was available to be restored to the safety buses approximately \\n22.6\\n hours after the event started and not 25 hours.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n Based on this comment and subsequent discussion with Region\\n 3 inspectors, we agree that credit for offsite power recovery at 24\\n hours should be provided.  \\nThe applicable text in the Anal\\nysis Assumptions (\\nSection\\n 3.4\\n) has been revised.  This \\nchange results in the mean CCDP decreasing from 1\\n×10-3 to 8\\n×10-4. D.3\\n Comments Concerning Base SPAR Model Considerations\\n  NextEra:\\n The SPAR model\\ns utilize generic data out of the NRC Reactor Operating \\nExperience Database. \\n The PWR\\nOG recently reviewed the component reliability data and \\nidentified that the \\nFTR data used in the SPAR models is potentially over\\n-estimating the \\nprobability of diesel failur\\nes. \\n The PWROG\\n, when reviewing this data, showed that the rate \\nfor diesel generators \\nFTR\\n could be reduced from 1.\\n4×10\\n-3 per hour to 8.4\\n×10\\n-4 per hour.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n This data issue, along with others previously reported \\nin PWROG\\n-18026-P, ﬁComponent \\nReliability Data Issues and Strategies\\n,ﬂ \\nis currently being reviewed by \\nthe NRC and INL.  \\nIn the interim, INL performed a revised calculation \\nfor the EDG FTR rate \\nusing data from \\nthe \\n2010Œ2019 period and \\nconsistent with\\n existing Institute of Nuclear \\nPower Operations (INPO) guidance. \\n This calculation resulted in \\nmean failure rate of \\n1.32\\n×10-3 per hour (\\n103 failures in 82,768 hours)\\n.  Note that the number of run hours from \\nfailures to load/run (FTLR) failure mode (i.e., f\\nailures to run within 1 hour) is not deducted \\nfrom the run hours in the FTR failure mode in the above calculation.\\n  This revised\\n failure rate \\nis only 1\\n3 percent\\n lower than the current EDG FTR rate of 1.52\\n×10-3 per hour.\\n  Since this \\nrevised\\n rate\\n is within a reasonable uncertainty range \\nof the FTR rate used in the analysis \\nand is not expected to make a significant impact on the overall CCDP\\n, the ED\\nG FTR rate \\nwas not changed in the best estimate case.\\n  NextEra:\\n The preliminary \\nASP analysis \\nassume\\ns that\\n core damage would occur without \\naccounting for the specific failure modes that were present in the cut\\n sets. \\n The most \\nsignificant conservatism was that \\nFTR events\\n (e.g., EDG or RCIC)\\n, were assumed to occur \\nat the start of the event\\n (i.e., t \\n= 0).  Howeve\\nr, this failure mode does not align with the \\ngeneric SPAR data as a\\nn FTR \\nevent is noted as occurring after the first hour and up to \\nLER 331\\n-2020-001   D-5 24 hours. \\n Incorporating this time dependence would allow for additional credit for FLEX \\nmitigation strategies.\\n RES Response\\n/Action:\\n The treatment of FTR events in the SPAR models is consistent \\nwith the current state\\n-of-practice.  \\nThe assumption that failures occur at the start of the event \\nis in part addressed by applying factors related to convolution of EDG FTR \\nevents.\\n  However, this convolution credit does not \\nmeaningfully \\naffect the analysis for this event \\nlargely due to \\nthe \\nlong time (~23 hours) until offsite power could be recovered.  It is \\nrecognized that this treatment is conservative, but the proper treatm\\nent of FTR failure would \\nlikely require aspects of ﬁdynamicﬂ PRA, which is beyond the scope of this analysis.\\n  NRR, Section 3.3:\\n We agree with the basis to eliminate the 72\\n-hour AC power recovery \\nrequirement since that assumption introduces an unnecessary conservatism.  This raises an \\nissue in the opinion of at least this analyst that we should follow\\n-up on.  Should we consider \\neli\\nminating this conservatism from SPAR models to enhance their accuracy after further \\ndiscussions among cognizant stakeholders (NRR\\n\\DRA, RES\\n\\DRA, SRAs, and INL staff)?\\n RES Response/Action:\\n This issue will be discussed with internal stakeholders to determine \\nif there is a consensus opinion\\n to eliminate the 72\\n-hour AC power recovery requirement\\n in \\nall SPAR models\\n.  Region 3, Section 3.3:\\n HPCI credit during ELAP and SBO\\n-ELAP event tree changes to \\nquery containment venting if reactor depressurization fails.  If th\\nese model changes are \\napplied for this event, they should be made to other BWR SPAR models.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n RES\\n will consider\\n similar SPAR model modifications\\n to applicable \\nplants\\n, as appro\\npriate\\n.</td>\n",

An Unusual Event was declared at 1258. All Safety Systems performed as designed. As a result of the LOOP, the 'A' and 'B' Emergency Diesel Generators automatically started and supplied power to the safety related busses. As a result, the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) automatically initiated and injected into the reactor. In addition, containment isolations occurred, as expected for this event. This resulted in a 4-hour event report to the NRC under 10 CFR 50.72 section 50.72{b)(2)(iv)(A) -ECCS Injection, 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) -RPS Actuation -Critical, 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) -Valid Specific System Actuation (reference EN#54826). The NOUE was exited at 1600 on August 11, 2020. The cause of the LOOP was an extremely severe storm (called a Derecho) with heavy rains and very high winds. This event had no impact on public health or safety. There were no systems, structures, or components inoperable at the time of the event that contributed to the event. This I event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50. 73(a)(2)(iv)(A), 50. 73(a)(2)(v)(C) and 50. 73(a)(2)(iii). There were no radiological releases associated with this event.

DOCKET NUMBER Duane Arnold Energy Center 05000-331 NARRATIVE I. Description of Event: YEAR 2020 3. LER NUMBER SEQUENTIAL NUMBER -001 REV NO. -01 On August 10, 2020, at 1246 CDT, while operating at 80% power, NextEra Energy Duane Arnold· (DAEC) experienced a Generator Load reject and subsequent reactor scram as a result of a loss of offsite power (LOOP) due to extremely high winds. An Unusual Event was declared at 1258. All Safety Systems performed as designed. As a result of the LOOP, the 'A' and 'B' Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs) automatically started and supplied power to the safety related busses. In response to the expected Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) level transient, the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) automatically started and injected. In addition, containment isolations occurred, as expected for this event. This resulted in a 4-hour event report to the NRC under 10 CFR 50. 72 section 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(A) -ECCS Injection, 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) -RPS Actuation -Critical, 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) -Valid Specific System Actuation (reference EN#54826). The cause of the LOOP was an extremely severe storm ( called a Derecho) with heavy rains and very high winds. This event had no impact on public health or safety. There were no systems, structures, or components inoperable at the time of the event that contributed to the event. The Unusual Event was exited at 1600 on August 11, 2020. IL Assessment of Safety Consequences: In response to the LOOP, the plant experienced a Generator Lockout, Turbine Trip and Reactor Scram. The operating crew entered the appropriate emergency procedures. The EDG's quickly re-energized tlie safety-related electrical busses and restored power. The Reactor Protection System (RPS) power was never lost as the EDG's were able to recover power to the essential buses quickly. This prevented a Main Steam Isolation Valve (MSIV) isolation signal and thus allowed the Main Condenser to remain available post event. As expected for this event, RPV level dropped below L2 setpoint (119.5\") initiating the HPCI and RCIC systems. Reactor level recovered quickly. The Low Low Set System functioned as designed initially opening two primary system relief valves to control reactor pressure.

LER NUMBER SEQUENTIAL NUMBER -001 Operators were quickly able to establish pressure control initially via Steam Line Drains and RCIC and establish a cooldown rate. Both recirculating pumps tripped when power was lost to their associated non-safety related electrical busses. The operators followed procedures for cooldown with no forced circulation in the core. When Shutdown Cooling was placed in service, forced circulation was re-established which resulted in exceeding the bottom head cooldown limits of 100 degrees per hour. This was anticipated and could not be avoided. On August 12, a small cut was discovered in the Reactor Building 5th floor wall that was the result of storm damage. A test of the Secondary Containment boundary was conducted to determine the effect of the cut. The vacuum able to be drawn on secondary containment with one train of Standby Gas Treatment.System (SGTS) was 0.24 inches of water. The vacuum required to be drawn by Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement is 0.25 inches of water. Secondary Containment was declared inoperable with the plant not in the mode of applicability (Mode 4, Cold Shutdown). During a review of past operability of Secondary Containment, it was determined that the cut in the Reactor Building wall likely existed during the period the plant was cooling down in Mode 3, Hot Shutdown. Secondary Containment is required to be operable in Mode 3. DAEC design basis \\ndocuments state the design safety criteria for SGTS is to \"limit exfiltration from the secondary containment during periods of primary and/or secondary containment isolation\" and \"to control outward leakage of the atmosphere from the secondary containment\". Therefore, the safety function of SGTS and Secondary Containment was maintained by the ability to draw a substantial vacuum of 0.24 inches of water with the cut in the Reactor Building wall. Although the safety function of Secondary Containment and SGTS was maintained throughout this event, the reporting criteria in NUREG-1022 for 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C) states\" ... a report is required when 1) there is a determination that the SSC is inoperable in a required mode or other specified condition, 2) the inoperability is due to ... equipment failures ... , and 3) no redundant equipment in the same system was operable.\" Since Secondary Containment was declared inoperable, it meets the reporting criteria outlined in NUREG-1022. This event did not result in a Safety System Functional Failure.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER Duane Arnold Energy Center 05000-331 Ill. Cause of Event: YEAR 2020 3. LERNUMBER SEQUENTIAL NUMBER -001 The cause of the LOOP was an extremely severe storm (called a Derecho) with heavy rains and very high winds. Wind speeds exceeded 80 mph for over 20 minutes with peaks on site at greater than 100 mph. The National Weather Service later estimated wind speeds were likely near 130 mph. These winds resulted in all 6 off site power sources (4 -161 kV and 2 -\\n345 kV) coming into the DAEC switchyard being damaged or downed. A separate offsite 69 kV line which feeds non-essential plant loads was also damaged. IV. Corrective Actions: REV NO. -01 The high winds experienced on August 10, 2020 were not considered a beyond design basis event. The systems and components responded as designed and the overall peak wind speeds were within the Design Basis Tornado. The damage observed coincides with the amount of damage expected for the event. Given this event was outside the control of the station staff and that all components worked as designed, no additional corrective actions beyond repair/recovery efforts related to the wind storm are needed.

The Group 8 valves were closed at the \\ntime of the event. \\n Per design, the \\nLOOP \\nalso caused a Group 1 (i.e., main steam isolation \\nvalve) isolation.\\n  The Unit 1 LOOP did not affect Unit 2, which remained at 100\\n-percent power\\n.  Operators restored offsite power to the Unit 1 nonsafety\\n-related buses from the UAT in \\napproximately 37\\n minutes.\\n  Offsite power was restored \\nto the two safety buses via the station \\nauxiliary transformer (SAT) \\nand the Unusual \\nEvent\\n was exited at 2:54 p\\n.m. on August 4\\nth. This accident sequence precursor (ASP) analysis reveals that the most likely core damage \\n\\nsequence \\nis a loss of offsite power (LOOP) initiating event and the successful operation of the \\nEDGs providing safety\\n-related alternating current (AC) power with subsequent (postulated) \\nfailure of both HPCI and RCIC and operators failing to depressurize the reactor\\n.  This accident \\nsequence accounts for approximately 7\\n2 percent of the total conditional core damage probability \\n(CCDP) for this event.\\n  FLEX mitigation strategies were credited in this analysis; however, the \\nrisk impact was minimal because postulated stat\\nion blackout (SBO) scenarios are not a \\ndominant risk contributor.\\n  The ASP analysis\\n results\\n reinforce\\n that a LOOP \\nresulting from\\n natural phenomenon outside the licensees™ control is a s\\nubstantial \\nrisk contributor\\n; however,\\n plant and operator response were\\n timely and appropriate to mitigate the risk of the event.\\n LER \\n325-2020-003  2 2 EVENT \\nDETAILS \\n  2.1 Event Description\\n On August 3, 2020\\n, a LOOP \\noccurred on \\nBrunswick Steam Electric Plant Uni\\nt 1 that resulted in \\na reactor scram.

The Group 8 valves were closed at the \\ntime of the event. \\n Per design, the \\nLOOP \\nalso caused a Group 1 (i.e., main steam isolation \\nvalve) isolation.\\n  The Uni\\nt 1 LOOP did not affect Unit 2, which remained at 100\\n-percent power.\\n1  Operators restored offsite power to the \\nUnit 1 \\nnonsafety\\n-related buses from the\\n UAT in \\napproximately 37\\n minutes.\\n  Offsite power was restored \\nto the two safety buses via the SAT \\nand the Unusual Event was exited at 2:54 pm. on August 4\\nth.  Additional information is provided in \\nlicensee event report (L\\nER) 325-2020-002, ﬁAutomatic Specified System Actuations due to Loss \\nof Offsite Power\\n,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML20265A162\\n). 2.2 Cause\\n The licensee determined that the \\nelectrical fault that \\nresulted \\nin \\nthe transformer bus powering \\nthe SAT to trip and\\n the subsequent LOOP was \\ncaused \\nstorm\\n-generated debris from\\n Hurricane \\nIsaias\\n. 3 MODELING \\n  3.1 SDP Results/Basis for ASP Analysis\\n The ASP Program performs independent analyses for initiating events. \\n ASP analyses of\\n initiating events account for all failures/degraded conditions and unavailabilities (e.g., equipment\\n \\nout for maintenance) th\\nat occurred during the event, regardless of licensee performance.\\n2 Additional LERs were reviewed to determine if concurrent unavailabilities existed during the\\n August 3\\nrd event. \\n No windowed events were identified.\\n  Discussions with Region 2 staff indicate\\n that no licensee performance deficienc\\ny associated with this event ha\\ns been identified; \\nhowever, the LER remains open.\\n 3.2 Analysis Type\\n An initiating event analysis \\nwas performed using \\nRevision\\n 9.33 of the standardized plant \\nanalysis risk (SPAR) model for \\nBrunswick Steam Electric Plant\\n (Unit\\n 1) created on \\nJuly\\n 31, 2020.  This event was modeled as a switchyard\\n-centered LOOP initiating event.\\n  1  The Unit 2 EDGs started but did not load onto their respective safety buses because they remained energized \\nvia offsite power throughout the event.\\n 2  ASP analyses also account for any degraded condition(s) that were identified after the initiating event occurred if\\n the failure/degradation exposure \\ntime\\n(s) overlapped the initiating event date.\\n LER \\n325-2020-003  3 3.3 SPAR Model Modifications\\n No SPAR model modifications were needed for\\n this analysis.\\n 3.4 Analysis\\n Assumptions\\n The following modeling assumptions were determined to be significant to the modeling of this \\ninitiating \\nevent assessment:\\n  The probability of IE\\n-LOOPSC (\\nloss of offsite power (switchyard\\n-centered)\\n) was set to \\n1.0 due to the loss of offsite power. \\n All other initiating event probabilities were set to \\nzero.\\n  Basic event OEP\\n-VCF\\n-LP-SITESC (\\nsite LOOP (switchyard\\n-centered)\\n) was set to FALSE \\nbecause the event was single unit LOOP.\\n  The probability of basic event FLX\\n-XHE\\n-XM-ELAP (\\noperators fail to declare \\nELAP\\n when \\nbeneficial\\n) was set to \\nit nominal \\nvalue of 1\\n×10-2 to activate the credit for FLEX mitigation \\nstrategies for SBO scenarios for which an extended loss of AC power (ELAP) is \\ndeclared.  Sensitivity analyses show that \\nthe amount of FLEX credit \\nhas a \\nminimal\\n impact on the\\n analysis\\n results.\\n  Offsite power was restored \\nto the two safety buses via the SAT in approximately 15 and \\n17 hours, respectively\\n.  It is believed that operators could have restored offsite power \\nmore quic\\nkly if postulated\\n SBO had occurred.  However, \\nan exact determination on \\nwhen \\nthe offsite\\n power\\n could have been restored is not available\\n.  Given this uncertainty, \\nbasic event\\ns OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR30MSC (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in \\n30 minutes\\n) and OEP-XHE\\n-XL-NR0\\n2HSC (operators fail to recover offsite power in \\n2 hours) were\\n set to TRUE. \\n Although this assumption is potential\\nly conservative, \\nsensitivity analyses show \\ncredit for \\nthe \\noffsite power recovery \\nhas a \\nminimal impact\\n on the analysis results.\\n 4 ANALYSIS RESULTS \\n  4.1 Results\\n The mean\\n CCDP \\nfor this analysis is calculated to be \\n2.0×10-5.  The ASP Program threshold \\nfor \\ninitiating events \\nis a CCDP of \\n10-6 or the \\nplant\\n-specific \\nCCDP of an uncomplicated reactor trip \\nwith a non\\n-recoverable loss of feed water or the condenser heat sink, whichever is greater. \\n This \\nCCDP equivalent for \\nBrunswick Steam Electric \\nPlant (Unit \\n1) is \\n1.5×10-5.

Abstract\\n (Limit to 1560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) \\nAt 23:02 Eastern Daylight Time on August \\n3, 2020, with Unit 1 in Mode 1 at approxim\\nately 19% power during Hurricane Isaias, a l\\noss of the transformer bus powering the Startup Auxiliary Transformer (\\nSAT) resulted in a Loss of Offs\\nite Power (LOOP). By design, \\nall Main Steam Isolation Valves closed and an \\nautomatic reactor scram occurred. All contro\\nl rods inserted as expected on the scram.\\n At the time of this event the main generator \\nwas removed from service due to unrelated ge\\nnerator ground issues and all plant loads\\n were \\nbeing supplied by the SAT. \\nBy design, the LOOP resulted in automatic \\nactuation of Primary Containm\\nent Isolation System (PCIS) \\nGroup 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 isol\\nation \\nvalves. In addition, all four emergency diesel generators (EDGs)\\n started, with EDGs 1 and 2 loadin\\ng to their respective emergen\\ncy buses per design. Reactor water level reached low level 1 followi\\nng the scram resulting in automat\\nic actuation of PCIS Groups 2\\n, 6, and 8, by design. \\nThe electrical fault that caused the transformer bus powering \\nthe SAT to trip and subsequent LOOP was determined to be a result\\n of storm generated debris. \\nThere was no impact on the health and safety of the public or \\nplant personnel. This event is being reported in accordance with \\n 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to valid actuation of\\n the Reactor Protection System, PCIS, and EDGs. \\n(See Page 3 for required number of digits/characters for each block) \\n(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form \\nhttp://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/\\n)  NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION \\n(08-2020) \\n LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) \\n CONTINUATION SHEET \\n(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form \\nhttp://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/\\n) APPROVED BY OMB:  NO. 3150-0104 EXPIRES:  08/31/2023 \\n Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

Unit 2\\n was in Mode 1 (i.e., Power Operation), at approx\\nimately 100 percent rated thermal power.  \\n Reportability Criteria \\n \\nThis event is being reported in accordanc\\ne with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A\\n) because it involved actuat\\nion of systems listed in  \\n10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). Specifically, the \\nReactor Protection System (RPS) [JC], Prim\\nary Containment Isolat\\nion System (PCIS) \\n[JM], and the Emergency Diesel Generators (EDG\\ns) [EK] actuated during this event.   \\n Per 10 CFR 50.72(a)(1)(i), the NRC was notified of an Unusual Ev\\nent (UE) being declared via Event Notification 54812 at 23:31 \\nEastern Daylight Time (EDT) on August 3,\\n 2020. The NRC was notified of the RPS [JC]\\n actuation while critical and the valid \\nspecified system actuations per \\n10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv\\n)(A), respectively, via an update to Event \\nNotification 54812 at 01:20 EDT on August 4, 2020.   \\n Event Description \\n \\nAt 23:02 EDT on August 3, 2020, \\nwith Unit 1 in Mode 1 at approximately 19% \\npower during Hurricane Isaias, a loss of the \\ntransformer bus powering the Startup Auxiliary Transformer (SAT) [EA] resulted in a Loss of Offsite Power (LOOP). By design, al\\nl Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIVs) [JM] closed and an automati\\nc reactor scram occurred. All c\\nontrol rods inserted as expected \\non the scram.   At the time of this event the main genera\\ntor was removed from service and all plant loads were being supplied by the SAT. Power\\n had been lowered to 19% prior to the event in preparation for \\nshutting down for maintenance associated with unrelated generator\\n ground issues.  \\n By design, the LOOP resulted in automatic\\n actuation of Primary Contai\\nnment Isolation System (PCIS)\\n Group 1 (i.e., main steam), \\nGroup 2 (i.e., floor and equipment drain), Group 3 (i.e., reac\\ntor water cleanup), Group 6 (i.e., monitoring and sampling), and \\nGroup 8 (i.e., shutdown cooling) isolation valves. In addition, all four \\nemergency diesel generators (EDG\\ns) started, with EDGs 1 and 2 loading to their respective emergency buses per design. Reacto\\nr water level reached low level 1 following the scram resulting i\\nn automatic actuation of PCIS Gr\\noups 2, 6, and 8, by design. \\n At 23:12 EDT on August 3, 2020, Unit 1 dec\\nlared a UE due to the LOOP. The UE wa\\ns exited at 14:54 on August 4, 2020.  \\n Event Cause \\n \\nExtensive investigation and testi\\nng concluded that the electrical \\nfault that caused the transformer bus powering the SAT to tri\\np and subsequent LOOP was not a result of an equi\\npment failure. The fault was determined to \\nbe a result of storm generated debris fro\\nm Hurricane Isaias.  \\n Safety Assessment \\n There was no adverse impact on the health and \\nsafety of the public. The safety significa\\nnce of this event is minimal. The autom\\natic reactor trip was as expected, and all safety related systems operated as designed. \\n     NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION \\n(08-2020) \\n LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) \\n CONTINUATION SHEET \\n(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form \\nhttp://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/\\n) APPROVED BY OMB:  NO. 3150-0104 EXPIRES:  08/31/2023 \\n Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

Cook \\nNuclear Plant\\ns 1 and 2 created \\nin December \\n2020.  This \\nTLU model includes an \\ninadver\\ntent SI actuation \\nevent\\n tree to allow the modeling of this \\nevent\\n. 3.3 SPAR Model Modifications\\n The following SPAR model modifications were made to support this analysis:\\n  The event tree branch for th\\ne ISINJ (\\ninadvertent SI\\n) event tree was modified.  \\nSpecifically, the transfers to the \\nSLOCA (\\nsmall LOCA\\n) event tree were removed \\nand replace\\nd by branching within the parent event tree.\\n  These changes eliminate \\nunnecessary queries in the SLOCA event tree.  \\nIn addition, the\\n OEP (\\nconsequential loss \\nof offsite power\\n) top event\\n and transfer to the \\nLOOPPC (\\nplant\\n-centered loss of offsite \\npower\\n) event tree was inserted\\n to account for potential consequential LOOP during the \\nevent\\n.  The transfer for the failure of the reactor protection sys\\ntem sequence was \\n 1  ASP analyses also \\naccount for any degraded condition(s) that were identified after the initiating event occurred if\\n the failure/degradation exposure \\ntime\\n(s) overlapped the initiating event date.\\n LER \\n316-2020-003  3 changed\\n to the ATWS (\\nanticipated transient without scram\\n) event tree.  The modified \\nISINJ \\nevent tree is \\nprovided in \\nFigure\\n A-1 of Appendix\\n A.  Basic event \\nPPR-PRV\\n-CO-TRANS \\n(PORVs/SRVs open during \\ntransient\\n) was changed \\nto its complement\\n under gate PORV\\n-4 in the PORV (\\nPORVs are closed\\n) fault tree.\\n  This \\nchange \\nwas made to account for the pressurizer safety relief valves not being \\nchallenged if the PORVs lift during the SI actuation.\\n 3.4 Analysis\\n Assumpt\\nions The following modeling assumptions were determined to be significant to the modeling of this \\ninitiating \\nevent assessment:\\n  The probability of IE\\n-ISINJ\\n (inadvertent safety injection\\n) was set to 1.0 due to \\nautomatic \\nSI actuation\\n.  All other \\ninitiating event probabilities were set to zero.\\n  Basic event\\n PPR-PRV\\n-CO-TRANS \\nwas set to TRUE because the PORVs opened s\\neven\\n times during the event response.\\n  The pressurizer PORVs \\nexperience \\nseven\\n demands\\n due to high RCS pressure as a \\nresult of the SI a\\nctu\\nation.  T\\no account for the increased failure of these \\nPORVs\\n to successfully reclose after the opening, the associated failure probabilities were modified \\nusing binominal expansion to account for their greater likelihood of failure.  Basic event\\n ZT-PRV-OO-PZR-R1 (one pressurizer PORV fails to reclose after scram\\n) was\\n set to \\n1×10-2. 4 ANALYSIS RESULTS \\n  4.1 Results\\n The mean\\n CCDP \\nfor this analysis is calculated to be \\n1×10-5.  The ASP Program threshold \\nfor \\ninitiating events \\nis a CCDP of \\n10-6 or the \\nplant\\n-specific \\nCCDP of an uncomplicated reactor trip \\nwith a non\\n-recoverable loss of feedwater or the condenser heat sink, whichever is greater. \\n This \\nCCDP equivalent for \\nD.C.

The EDG\\ns did not \\nimmediately \\nenergize\\n their respective safety buses beca\\nuse offsite power remained available.  \\nHowever, approximately \\n14 minutes later, \\na loss of \\noffsite power\\n (LOOP)\\n occurred that resulted \\nin a reactor trip.

All control rods successfully inserted.  \\nReactor inventory control was maintained by reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) and the \\nsafety relief valves (SRVs) were used to remove decay heat to the torus.\\n The high winds resulted in minor damage to \\nthe \\nreactor, turbine, and FLEX building\\ns, along with \\nmore severe damage to the nonsafety\\n-related cooling towers.  \\nThe licensee later determined \\nthat, although damaged, secondary containment remained functional thr\\noughout the event and \\nif challenged, would have prevented a radiological release to the environment.  However, when \\n\\ntested, the vacuum drawn in secondary containment by the standby gas treatment system was \\nslightly below the technical specification\\n (TS)\\n limit.\\n In addition, t\\nhe high winds result\\ned in increase\\nd debris loading to the essential service water \\n(ESW) system, which cause\\nd clogging of the train\\n ‚B™ strainer\\n and subsequent decrease of ESW \\nflow of 300\\n gpm to EDG\\n ‚B™\\n.  Operators successfully bypassed t\\nhe strainer\\n.  The train ‚A™ \\nstrainer was also challenged due to debris during the event; however, the differential pressure \\n\\nacross the strainer reached a maximum of 11\\n psid, which is below the limit of 15\\n psid and, \\ntherefore,\\n did not require to be bypassed\\n.  Although the operators declared\\n EDG ‚B™ \\ninoperable\\n according to TS, i\\nt did not experience any problems due to the use of unstrained ESW\\n and ran \\nsuccessfully through\\nout the event\\n.  Operators restored offsite power to the safety buses \\napproximately 25\\n hours after the LOOP \\noccurred\\n. This accident sequence precursor (ASP) analysis reveals that the most likely core damage \\nsequence is a \\nweather\\n-related \\nLOOP initiating event and the subsequent \\n(postulated) \\nfailure of \\nboth EDGs resulting in a station blackout \\n(SBO)\\n with the postulated failure\\ns of both \\nhigh\\n-pressure coolant injection (\\nHPCI\\n) and RCIC and \\nthe \\ninability of \\noperators \\nto \\nrecover alternating \\ncurrent (AC) \\npower \\nwithin 30\\n minutes\\n.  This accident seque\\nnce accounts for approximately \\n35 percent of the total conditional core damage probability (CCDP) for this event.\\n  Although the \\nLER 331\\n-2020-001   2 mean \\nCCDP \\nof \\n8×10\\n-4 for this event \\nwas high\\n, the risk \\nof core damage was mitigated\\n because \\ndefense\\n-in-depth and plant\\n-wide safet\\ny margins were maintained.\\n FLEX mitigation strategies were credited in this analysis\\n and significantly \\naffected the results.  \\nSpecifically, \\nwithout \\nthe mitigation capabilities of the \\nFLEX strategies \\nwould have \\nresult\\ned in a \\nCCDP approximately\\n a factor of \\n10 higher for \\nthis event\\n.  Throughout the review\\n of this event\\n, the analysis \\nassumptions and\\n results were systematically review\\ned to identify necessary \\nstandardized plant analysis risk (\\nSPAR) model changes \\nthat \\nwere \\nimplemented\\n to realisticall\\ny represent the event \\nand expected plant response.  In addition, \\nanalysis \\nresults were al\\nso use\\nd to identify key sources of uncertainty\\n. The risk of this event was significantly impacted by the \\nSBO scenarios. \\n The risk associated with \\nthe SBO scenarios is \\nparticularly high for this plant because\\n of having \\nonly two \\nsafety\\n-related \\nEDGs\\n and \\nthe in\\nability to crosstie safety\\n-related buses\\n from another unit\\n as Duane Arnold is a \\nsingle unit site\\n. 2 EVENT DETAILS \\n  2.1\\n Event Description\\n On August\\n 10, 2020, \\nsevere thunder\\nstorms and high winds caused a grid \\nperturbation that \\nresulted in an automatic start of both \\nEDGs.\\n  The EDG did not immediately \\nenergize\\n their \\nrespective safety buses because\\n offsite power remained available.  However, approximately \\n14 minutes later, \\na LOOP occurred resulting\\n in a reactor trip.  The output breakers for both \\nEDGs automatically closed to reenergize the safety buses.\\n The licensee declared \\nan Unusual \\nEvent\\n.  All control rods successfully inserted.

However, when \\ntested, the vacuum drawn in secondary con\\ntainment by the standby gas treatment system was \\nslightly below the \\nTS limit.\\n In addition, t\\nhe high winds result\\ned in increase\\nd debris loading to the ESW system, which \\ncause\\nd complete \\nclogging of the train\\n ‚B™ strainer\\n and subsequent\\n decrease of ESW flow o\\nf 300 gpm to EDG\\n ‚B™\\n.  Operators successfully bypassed the strainer\\n.  The train ‚A™ strainer was \\nalso challenged due to debris during the event; however, the differential pressure across the \\nstrainer reached a maximum of 11\\n psid, which is below the \\nlimit of 15\\n psid\\n and, therefore, did \\nnot require to be bypassed\\n.  Although the operators declared\\n EDG\\n ‚B™ \\ninoperable according to \\nTS, it\\n did not experience any problems due to the use of unstrained ESW\\n and ran successfully \\nthroughout the event\\n.  Operators \\nrestored offsite power to the safety buses approximately 25 \\nhours after the LOOP \\noccurred\\n.

Sequence of Key Events\\n August 10, 2020\\n 1138 Licensee entered abnormal operation procedures after a severe weather watch was issued\\n for the plant vicinity\\n; hourly checks\\n of the EDGs\\n were initiated and the licensee suspended \\nfuel movements\\n. 1235 Grid \\n\\n 1249 LOOP cause\\nd a main generator trip on reverse power automatic reactor scram.

The main steam isolation valves (MSIVs) remained open throughout the event.  During \\nmost LOOPs, the MSIVs will close due to the loss\\n of power from the reactor protection \\nsystem (RPS) motor generators.  However, the starting of the EDGs due to the grid \\n\\nperturbation prior to the LOOP allowed for a faster reenergization of the safety \\nbuses \\nprior\\n to the voltage from RPS motor generators \\ndecre\\nasing \\nbelow the value that would \\nresult in a loss of power to the MSIVs.  Because the MSIVs remained open, operators \\naligned the main steam line\\n (MSL)\\n drains\\n to the condenser\\n, which \\nminimized the number \\nof demands on the reactor \\nSRVs \\n(two SRVs each cycled \\nopen and closed one \\ntime\\n).  The current SPAR models use a failure\\n-to-close probability for SRVs of 9.6×10\\n-2 taken \\nfrom \\nNUREG\\n-1150, ﬁSevere Accident Risks: An Assessment for Five U.S. \\nNuclear \\nPower Plants\\n,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML120960691)\\n.  This probability \\naccounts for \\nmultiple SRV demands\\n; therefore, this probability was not changed given the two \\ndemands experienced during the event and the expected additional demands during a \\npostu\\nlated SBO in which the MSIVs would close.\\n  NUREG/CR\\n-7037, ﬁIndustry \\nPerformance of Relief Valves at U.S. Commercial Nuclear Power Plants through 2007,ﬂ\\n (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML110980205\\n) has an\\n updated reliability estimate; however, the \\nLER 331\\n-2020-001   4 adequacy of SRV testing that is included in these estimates has come into question.  \\nSpecifically, \\ntesting is \\nperformed \\nto demonstrate that the SRVs will open to relieve \\npressure during design\\n-basis accidents to \\nprevent overpressure of the reactor coolant \\nsystem.  However, the closing capability \\nof SRVs \\nis not tested \\nafter passing \\nsteam\\n.  In \\naddition, there \\nare\\n concerns about the demand data used in the stuck\\n-open SRV \\nprobability provided in \\nNUREG/CR\\n-7037.  The probability taken from \\nNUREG\\n-1150 is \\npotentially\\n conservative\\n; however, t\\nhe effect of the stuck\\n-open SRV probability on this \\nanaly\\nsis is largely mitigated by the credit of the di\\nesel\\n-driven firewater pump and FLEX \\nRPV makeup pumps for these scenarios\\n.  During the event, the running spent fuel pool (SFP) cooling pump ‚A™ tripped.  Operators \\nimmediately started SFP cooling pump ‚B™.\\n  Prior to the event, the licensee was loading fuel into a spent fuel canister. \\n These fuel \\nmoves were stopped prior to the storms affecting the site; the fuel and canister were \\nplace\\nd in a safe condition within the SFP.\\n  On August 12, a small \\ntear\\n was discov\\nered in the \\n5th floor wall of the r\\neactor \\nbuilding\\n that \\nwas the result of storm damage. \\n A subsequent \\ntest of the \\nsecondary \\ncontainment \\nboundary \\nidentified that the vacuum of \\n0.24 inches of water\\n was \\nless that the t\\nechnical \\nspecification \\nrequirement \\nof 0.25 inches of water. \\n At the time of discovery, the plant was\\n is in Mode 4, which does not require s\\necondary \\ncontainment \\nto be operable\\n.  However, \\nit \\nis very likely that \\nthe \\ntear\\n in the \\nreactor \\nbuilding wall likely existed \\nwhile the \\nplant wa\\ns in \\nMode 3\\n after the \\nreactor scram and, therefore, se\\ncondary \\ncontainment \\nwas inoperable \\nduring this period\\n.  Although considered inoperable, the licensee determined that a \\nvacuum of \\n0.24 inches of water was sufficient to \\nmaintain \\nthe safety function of \\nsecondary containment\\n. 3 MODELING \\n  3.1\\n Basis for ASP Analysis\\n The ASP Program performs independent analyses for initiating events.  ASP analyses of \\ninitiating events account for all failures/d\\negraded conditions and unavailabilities (e.g., equipment \\nout for maintenance) that occurred during the event, regardless of licensee performance.\\n1  Additional LERs were reviewed to determine if concurrent unavailabilities existed during the \\nAugust\\n 10th eve\\nnt.  No windowed events were identified.\\n The plant and licensee response to this event was evaluated by NRC inspectors \\nas \\ndocumented \\nin \\ninspection report 05000331/2020003\\n, ﬁDuane Arnold Energy Center \\nŒ Integrated Inspection \\nReport\\n 05000331/2020003 \\nand 07200032/2020001\\n,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML20314A150\\n).  \\nInspectors evaluated th\\ne licensee's immediate and follow\\n-up corrective\\n actions to this event. \\n The inspectors \\nalso \\ndetermined that all equipment\\n responded as expected with \\na few \\nexceptions\\n (e.g., \\nloss of spent fuel\\n pool cooling\\n), and operators followed appropriate\\n response \\nproce\\ndures. \\n The inspectors determined that the licensee's corrective actions to\\n address this \\ncomplex event were appropriate to the circumstances and commensurate with\\n the potential \\nsafety significance.\\n  No findings or violations of more than minor significance\\n were identified.\\n  1  ASP analyses also account for any degraded condition(s) that were identified after the initiating event occurred if\\n the failure/degradation exposure \\ntime\\n(s) overlapped the initiating event date.\\n LER 331\\n-2020-001   5 3.2\\n Analysis Type\\n An initiating event analysis \\nwas performed using \\nRevision\\n 8.56\\n of the \\nSPAR model for \\nDuane \\nArnold Energy Center\\n created \\nin June\\n 2019.  This event was modeled as a \\nweather\\n-related\\n LOOP initiating event.\\n 3.3\\n SPAR Model \\nModifications\\n The following modifications were required for this initiating event analysis:\\n  Crediting FLEX Strategies\\n.  The probability of basic event FLX\\n-XHE\\n-XE-ELAP \\n(operators fail to declare ELAP when beneficial\\n) was set to its nominal value of 10\\n-2 to \\nactivate the credit for FLEX mitigation strategies for postulated SBO scenarios for which \\nan extended loss of AC power (ELAP) is declared.\\n2  FLEX Reliability Parameters\\n.  FLEX \\nhardware reliability \\nparameters suitable for inclusion \\nin the NRC SPAR models \\nis \\nnot yet\\n available.  Therefore, \\nthe \\nbase \\nSPAR model\\ns currently \\nuse the reliability\\n parameters\\n of permanently installed equipment\\n, which is\\n inconsistent with the limited experience with \\nthe operation of \\nFLEX\\n equipment\\n.  As part \\nof \\nan NRC audit \\nperformed \\nof p\\nreliminary FLEX \\nhardware data provided by the \\nPressurized Water Reactor Owner™s Group (PWROG)\\n, Idaho National Laboratory\\n reviewed the FLEX hardware parameter\\ns estimated by the PWROG\\n.  This review \\nrevealed that \\nFLEX diesel generator failure\\n-to-start\\n (FTS)\\n probability \\nis 3 to 10\\n times \\nhigher\\n and failure\\n-to-run\\n (FTR)\\n rate is \\n2 to 5\\n times \\nhigher than permanently installed \\nEDGs\\n.  The portable \\nengine\\n-driven\\n centrifugal pump FTS\\n probability\\n is \\nat least \\n8 times \\nhigher\\n and FTR rate \\nis \\nat least \\n6 times \\nhigher than permanently installed pumps\\n.  See \\nTable\\n 1 in \\nINL/EXT\\n-20-58327\\n, ﬁEvaluation of Weakly Informed Priors for FLEX Data\\n,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML20155K834)\\n for addition\\nal information.\\n  Therefore, t\\no provide \\na more representative\\n estimate of the FLEX \\nhardware r\\neliability\\n parameters, this \\nanalysi\\ns increased the hardware reliability \\nby a \\nfactor of \\nthree \\nin the best estimate case\\n.  The use of th\\ne FLEX hardware \\nmultiplier\\n is a key \\nmodeling\\n uncertainty\\n and is evaluated \\nfurther \\nin Section 4.3\\n.  Removal of EDG Repair Credit for ELAP Scenarios\\n.  The base SPAR model provides \\ncredit for repair of postulated EDG \\nfailures for SBO scen\\narios.  However, this potential \\ncredit is not applicable for scenarios where ELAP will be declared because (a.) operators \\n\\nwill be focused on implementing the FLEX mitigation strategies and (b.) the DC load \\nshedding activities could preclude recovery of EDG\\ns.  Therefore, credit for EDG repair \\ncredit was removed from the sequences if it is included after ELAP is likely declared \\n\\n(i.e.,\\n 1 hour)\\n via a change set containing the applicable EDG repair basic events\\n.  HPCI Credit\\n During ELAP Scenarios.\\n  The \\nbase SPAR model does not credit FLEX for \\nscenarios where RCIC is failed, but HPCI \\nis available\\n.  This assumption is likely \\nconservative and, therefore, \\nFLEX \\ncredit was\\n applied \\nby \\nmodifying the SBO event tree \\nby transferring the\\n SBO Sequence\\n 6 to the SBO ELAP event tree (see Figure\\n A-2 in \\nAppendix\\n A).  Most of the\\n FLEX information\\n available\\n, including \\nthermal\\n-hydraulic \\ncalcu\\nlations\\n, is focused on RCIC\\n performance and do\\nes not consider HPCI as an \\n 2  After the \\nDerecho storm had passed\\n the site, the licensee had the capability to pre\\n-stage FLEX equipment.  \\nHowever, after \\ndiscussing this possibility, the decision was made to\\n not move any \\nFLEX equipment.\\n LER 331\\n-2020-001   6 alternative high\\n-pressure injection source.\\n  Therefore, this \\nchange\\n is potentially \\nnonconservative.\\n  SBO-ELAP Event Tree Modification\\n.  The SBO\\n-ELAP event tree was modified to include \\nthe query of containment venting in scenarios when reactor depressurization fails.  \\nThe \\nmodified SBO\\n-ELAP event tree is provided in\\n Figure B\\n-1 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  Additional Mitigat\\nion Credit for Stuck\\n-Open SRV Scenarios\\n.  MELCOR calculations were \\nperformed to determine timing information \\nfor postulated stuck\\n-open SRV scenarios.  \\nSpecifically, the\\n time until RCIC/HPCI\\n isolation on low steam pressure (75 psig) and \\ntimes to core uncovery/damage\\n were calculated\\n.  Based on these calculations, the \\nRCIC \\nor HPCI would isolate on low steam pressure \\nin approximately 90\\n minutes given a single \\nstuck\\n-open SRV.  Core damage \\nis estim\\nated to occur \\nbetween\\n 4Œ6 hours.\\n  For \\ntwo \\nstuck\\n-open SRVs, \\nRCIC\\n/HPCI\\n would isolate in less than 1\\n hour and core d\\namage would \\noccur \\nin \\napproximately \\n90 minutes.  \\nDiscussions with the licensee revealed\\n that \\noperators\\n would have \\nenough\\n time to connect and initiate either firewater or FLEX \\nreactor \\npressure vessel (RPV) \\nmakeup\\n, which is not credited in the base SPAR model.  \\nTo provide this \\ncredit\\n, the \\napplicable sequences \\nwere transferred to the SBO\\n-ELAP \\nevent tree.\\n  In addition, offsite power recovery times for the SBO\\n-1 and SBO\\n-2 event \\ntrees were changed to \\n3 hours and 1\\n hour, respectively\\n, based on MELCOR calculation \\nestimates.\\n3  These modified event trees are provide\\nd in Figure\\ns B-2 and B\\n-3 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  72-Hour AC Power Recovery Requirement\\n.  The base SPAR model requires AC power \\nrecovery within 72\\n hours \\nfor a safe/stable end state for ELAP scenarios with successful \\nFLEX implementation.  If AC power is not recovered \\nin these scenarios, the SPAR \\nmodels assume core damage.  The American Society of Mechanical \\nEngineers/American Nuclear Society (ASME/ANS) probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) \\nstandard definition for safe/stable end state does not require AC power recovery. \\n Because of the large uncertainty in modeling assumptions related to availability and \\nreliability of components and strategies for mission times that are well beyond 24\\n hours \\nand the unclear basis for requiring AC power recovery within 72\\n hours, the 72\\n-hour AC \\npower requirement was eliminated in this analysis by inserting a new basic event, OPR\\n-72HR\\n-OFF (\\nno 72-hr OPR requirement\\n), under the top event in the OPR\\n-72H fault tree \\nand setting it to FALSE.  This change is considered a key modeling uncertainty for\\n this \\nanalysis.  This modified fault tree is provided in Figure\\n B-4 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  As part of this \\nchange, the FTR events for FLEX diesel generators and pumps have a 72\\n-hour mission \\ntime in the base SPAR model.  These mission \\ntimes were reset to be consistent with the \\n24-hour mission time used in the SPAR model.\\n  Credit for \\nTechnical Support Center (TSC) Diesel Generator\\n.  The SBO\\n-ELAP event tree \\ncurrent\\nly credits \\nthe \\nFLEX \\n480-volt (V) diesel generators\\n in the FLEX\\n-480 fault tree.  \\nHowever, \\nthe plant has \\nan additional \\nTSC diesel generator that can al\\nso charge the \\nsafety\\n-related batteries\\n.  Therefore, the FLEX\\n-480 fault tree was modified by inserting \\nthe existing\\n DG-TSC\\n fault tree and changing the existing gate structure\\n to ensure both \\nthe FLEX and TSC diesel generators a\\nre \\npotentially \\navailable to provide \\nbattery \\ncharging\\n.  The two human failure events (HFEs)\\n FLX\\n-XHE\\n-XM-480 (\\noperators fail to \\n 3  The associated \\nEDG repair times were also changed.  \\nHowever, this change does not affect this analysis\\n because EDG repair is not credited after ELAP is declared.\\n LER 331\\n-2020-001   7 stage or run or load or refuel 480V portable flex diesel\\n) and\\n EPS-XHE\\n-XM-TSC \\n(operator action to align TSC DG to battery chargers\\n) are treated as completely \\ndependent in the SPAR model post\\n-processing rules\\n.

The SBO\\n-ELAP event tree current\\nly credits FLEX RPV \\nmakeup\\n in the FLEX\\n-RPV fault tree.  However, \\nfirewater is not currently credited.\\n  Therefore, the \\nFLEX\\n-RPV fault tree \\nwas modified by inserting \\nthe \\nexisting \\nFWS fault tree\\n and changing the existing gate structure \\nto ensure both\\n firewater and the FLEX RPV \\nmakeup pumps are available to provide reactor inventory makeup.  \\nIn the FWS \\nfault \\ntree, t\\nhe human error probability (HEP) for existing \\nHFE FWS\\n-XHE\\n-XM-ERRLT \\n(operator fails \\nto align firewater injection\\n) was set to a screening value\\n 0.1\\n.4  In addition, \\nFWS\\n-XHE\\n-XM-ERRLT\\n and existing basic event FWS\\n-EDP\\n-TM1P49 (\\ndiesel fire pump is \\nunavailable because of maintenance\\n) were \\nmoved under a new ‚AND™ gate because the \\nfirewater pump \\nwas undergoing maintenance \\nat the onset of the event; however, \\noperators could clear the maintenance tags to restore the pump within 1 hour, if needed\\n.  The two HFEs \\nFWS\\n-XHE\\n-XM-ERRLT and \\nFLX-XHE\\n-XM-RPV\\n (operators fail to stage or \\nrun or supply or refill FLEX RPV pump\\n) are treated as completely dependent in the \\nSPAR model post\\n-processing rules.  \\nThis modified fault tree\\ns are\\n provided in \\nFigure\\ns B-6 and B-7 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  Use of Environmental Common\\n-Cause\\n Failure (CCF)\\n Parameters for ESW Strainers\\n.  To \\nimprove \\nthe realism in the \\nmodel\\ning of\\n potential \\nCCF\\n of the \\nESW \\nstrainers due to the \\nincreased debris loading experienced during the event,\\n the alpha factors for ESW \\nstrainers were modified to those of environmental events (instead of all causes)\\n, which \\nare more representative \\nof the conditions experienced during the event\\n.  Specifically,\\n the \\nalpha factors ZA\\n-STR\\n-PG-SWS\\n-02A01 \\n(alpha factor 1 \\nin group size 2 for component \\nSTR with failure mode PG:SWS\\n) and ZA\\n-STR\\n-PG-SWS\\n-02A02 (\\nalpha factor 2 in group \\nsize 2 for component STR with failure mode PG:SWS\\n) were changed from their nominal \\nvalues to 0.874 and 0.126,\\n respectively\\n.5  Credit for Ability to \\nBypass Clogged ESW Strainers\\n.  The ability for operators to bypass \\nthe clogged ESW strainers\\n is not included in the base SPAR model.  To provide this \\ncredit\\n, new fault trees ESW\\n-STRAINER\\n-A (ESW pump A discharge strainer plugs\\n) and \\nESW STRAINER\\n-B (ESW pump \\nA discharge strainer plugs\\n) were created\\n.  These two \\nnew fault trees include the existing strainer independent failure and CCF basic events \\nalong with new \\nHFE\\n ESW\\n-XHE\\n-XM-BYPASS (\\noperators fail to bypass plugged strainer\\n), \\nwhich credits the ability of operators to bypass a clogged ESW strainer.  \\nThese new fault \\ntrees are provided in Figures\\n B-6 and B\\n-7 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  ESW-XHE\\n-XM-BYPASS was \\nevaluated using \\nNUREG/CR\\n-6883, ﬁThe SPAR H Human Reliability Analysis Method,ﬂ \\n(ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML051950061).  The HEP for ESW\\n-XHE\\n-XM-BYPASS was \\ncalculated to be 1×10\\n-3; see Appendix\\n C for additional information\\n.  Fault tree ESW\\n-STRAINER\\n-A was inserted as a transfer tree in fault trees ESW\\n-A and ESW\\n-DGN\\n-A to \\nsubstitute for the existing strainer independent failure and CCF basic events.  Likewise, \\n 4  NUREG\\n-1792, ﬁGood Practices for Implementing Human Reliability \\nAnalysis,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession \\nNo.\\n ML051160213) provides that 0.1 is an appropriate screening (i.e., typically conservative) value for most post\\n-initiator HFEs.\\n 5  These alpha factor changes also affect the residual heat removal (RHR) service water heat syste\\nm strainers.  \\nThe RHR service water system takes its suction of the same pit as ESW.\\n LER 331\\n-2020-001   8 fault tree ESW\\n-STRAINER\\n-B was inserted in fault trees ESW\\n-B and ESW\\n-DGN\\n-B.  \\nThese modified \\nfault\\n trees are provided in Figures\\n B-8 through B\\n-13 in \\nAppendix\\n B.  Reactor Water Level Control During \\na LOOP\\n.  The existing \\nHFEs for reactor water level \\ncontrol using RCIC (\\nRCI-XHE\\n-XO-ERROR, \\nRCI-XHE\\n-XM-OPERATE\\n, RCI\\n-XHE\\n-XM-OPERATE2\\n) and/or HPCI (\\nHCI-XHE\\n-XO-ERROR, \\nHCI-XHE\\n-XO-ERROR1\\n) were not \\nevaluated \\nto \\naccount for the \\nprocedures directing operators to bypass the \\nhigh\\n reactor \\nwater level (Level 8) pump \\ntrips\\n, raise reactor wat\\ner level\\n, and control level in a\\n relatively \\nnarrow (\\n10-inch\\n) band when \\nforced circulation is lost\\n.  With the pump trips bypas\\nsed, a \\nfailure to control level could result in flooding the pump turbines \\nresulting in a loss of \\nboth high\\n-pressure injection systems\\n.  To better represent this action, a new ba\\nsic event \\nRCS-XHE\\n-XM-LEVEL (\\noperators fail to control reactor water level duri\\nng loss of forced \\ncirculation\\n) was inserted in the applicable fault trees\\n (HCI, HCI01, HCI02, RCI, RCI01, \\nRCI02, FLX\\n-TDP, FLX\\n-TDP\\n2) to replace the existing HFEs\\n for \\nLOOP scenarios\\n.  The HFE RCS\\n-XHE\\n-XM-LEVEL was evaluated using IDHEAS\\n-ECA methodology because \\nthe performance shaping factors \\n(PSF\\ns) of \\nthe \\nSPAR\\n-H method \\ndo not represent control \\nactions very well.\\n  The HEP for \\nRCS-XHE\\n-XM-LEVEL\\n was calculated to be \\n2×10\\n-2; see \\nAppendix\\n C for additional informati\\non.  SPAR Model Quantification Issues\\n.  A review of preliminary analysis results identified \\nsome \\nSPAR model quantifications issues that required \\nchanges.  First, t\\nhe component \\nID was deleted from basic event FWS\\n-EDP\\n-TM-1P49 (\\ndiesel fire pump is \\nunavailable \\nbecause of maintenance\\n) because it was causing calculation errors.\\n  Second, \\nsome \\nevent tree linkage rules were added to the SBO event tree. \\n These rules substituted in \\ninitiator specific \\npower recovery logic to facilitate more accurate calculat\\nion of success \\npath cut sets.\\n 3.4\\n Analysis\\n Assumptions\\n The following modeling assumptions were \\nrequired to reflect the plant status and event \\ncircumstances \\nfor\\n this initiating event assessment\\n:  The probability of IE\\n-LOOP\\nWR (loss of offsite power (\\nweather\\n-related\\n)) was set to 1.0 \\ndue to the loss of offsite power. \\n All other initiating event probabilities were set to zero.\\n  Basic event ESW\\n-STR\\n-PG-PDISB (\\nESW pump B discharge strainer 1S\\n-89B plugs\\n) was \\nset to TRUE due to ESW train ‚B™ strainer becoming \\nclogged during the event.\\n  Basic event FWS\\n-EDP\\n-TM-1P49\\n was set to \\nTRUE\\n because th\\ne pump was undergoing \\nmaintenance during the event.  All other test and maintenance probabilities were kept at \\ntheir nominal values.\\n  Offsite power was recovered to \\nthe \\nsafety buses approximately 25 hours after the LOOP \\noccurred\\n.  Based\\n on the event information and \\ndiscussions with \\nRegion\\n 3 inspectors, \\nit \\nwas determined that offsite\\n power could have been restored \\nto the safety buses \\nshortly \\nafter the\\n Vinton offsite power line was restor\\ned approximately 23 hours \\nafter\\n the LOOP \\noccurred\\n.  Therefore, basic events OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR30M\\nWR (operators fail to recover \\noffsite power in 30 minutes\\n), OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR01HWR (\\noperators fail to recover offsite \\npower in 1 hour\\n), OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR05HWR (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in 5 \\nhours\\n), OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR08HWR (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in 8 hours\\n), \\nOEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR10HWR (\\noperators fail to\\n recover offsite power in 10 hours\\n), \\nand \\nOEP\\n-LER 331\\n-2020-001   9 XHE\\n-XL-NR012HWR (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in 12 hours\\n) were set \\nTRUE.\\n  The HEP for b\\nasic event \\nOEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR024HWR (\\noperators fail to recover \\noffsite power in 24 hours\\n) was \\ncalculated\\n to be 2×10\\n-3; see \\nAppendix\\n C for additional \\ninformation\\n.  Both\\n control rod drive (CRD) pumps were impacted by using the \\nMSL\\n drains to the \\ncondenser for cooldown.  The operating CRD pump developed a seal leak\\n and was \\nsecured\\n.  In addition, operators manually started the standby pump\\n when \\nit became \\nvapor bound \\ndue to \\nthe \\nhigh \\nsuction \\nwater \\ntemperature.\\n  Therefore, basic events \\nCRD-MDP\\n-FR-A (CRD pump A fails to run\\n) and CRD\\n-MDP\\n-FS-B (CRD pump B fails to start\\n) were set to TRUE.\\n  This modeling assumption is potentially conservative; however, the \\nnonrecoverable failure of the CRD system results in negligible risk contribution for th\\nis \\nanalysis.\\n 4 ANALYSIS RESULTS \\n  4.1\\n Preliminary \\nResults\\n The mean\\n CCDP for this analysis is \\npreliminarily \\ncalculated to be \\n8×10\\n-4.  The ASP Program \\nthreshold for initiating events is a CCDP of 10\\n-6 or the \\nplant\\n-specific \\nCCDP of an uncomplicated \\nreactor trip \\nwith a non\\n-recoverable loss of feed water or the condenser heat sink, whichever is \\ngreater.

The results of any sensitivity \\nanalyses \\nperformed to \\nevaluate these uncertainties are provided in \\nTable\\n 4.  The Amount of Credit for \\nFLEX \\nMitigation Strategies\\n.  The credit\\ning of FLEX mitigation \\nstrategies has as significant impact on these analysis results\\n.  A sensitivity analysis \\nyields \\nan increase in \\nCCDP\\n of \\napproximately a factor of 10\\n with\\nout\\n FLEX credit.\\n  While \\ncredit is appropriate, it is important to note that th\\nere \\nare considerable un\\ncertainties\\n (as \\ndiscussed below)\\n associated with \\nvarious aspects of \\nFLEX modeling.\\n  HPCI Credit During ELAP Scenarios.\\n  The base SPAR model does not credit FLEX for \\nscenarios where RCIC is failed, but HPCI \\nis available.  This assumption is likely \\nconservative and, therefore, FLEX credit was applied by modifying the SBO event tree\\n.  Most of the FLEX information available, \\nincluding thermal\\n-hydraulic calcu\\nlations, is \\nfocused on RCIC performance and does not consider HPCI as an alternative high\\n-pressure injection source.  \\nBecause \\nthe use of\\n FLEX \\nin scenarios that only HPCI is \\navailable has not been analyzed, \\ncrediting \\nFLEX in\\n such \\nscenarios may\\n be unrealistic \\nand may \\noverestimate\\n the \\nrisk re\\nduction \\nachieved by crediting FLEX\\n.  A sensitivity \\nanalysi\\ns yields a\\nn increase in \\nCCDP of \\napproximately \\n120 percent \\nwithout FLEX credit\\n for scenarios where HPCI is successful and RCIC is un\\navailable/failed\\n.  FLEX Hardware Reliability\\n.  As previously mentioned, \\nhardware reliabilit\\nies\\n for FLEX \\nequipment \\nare\\n not \\ncurrently available and, therefore, the SPAR model uses the reliability \\nof permanently installed equipment\\n, which is \\nconsidered nonconservative\\n.  Based on \\npreliminary data received from the PWROG, failure probabilities and rates for FLEX \\ndiesel generators and engine\\n-driven centrifugal pump\\ns are \\n2 to \\n10 times \\nmore \\nlikely to \\nfail \\nthan \\npermanently installed \\nequipment\\n.  Ther\\nefore, \\nsensitivity analyses were \\nperformed using the multiplier range \\nof 2 to 10 times that of permanently installed \\nequipment\\n.  These sensitivity \\nanalyses yield a decrease in CCDP of \\n3 percent for a \\nmultiplier of 2 and an increase in CCDP of approximately\\n 18 percent \\nand\\n 57 percent\\n for \\nmultipliers of 5 and 10\\n, respectively\\n. LER 331\\n-2020-001   11  FLEX Human Reliability\\n.  D\\netailed human reliability analysis was not performed for FLEX \\nmitigation strategies\\n for the SPAR models\\n.  Placeholder values for the HEPs that were \\njudged to \\nbe reasonable by model developers are currently used.\\n  A re\\nview of these \\nHEPs did not identify any \\nsignificant \\nissues\\n and are judged to be reasonable for this \\nanalysis\\n.  Future HRA \\nof these actions will likely result in\\n HEP\\n increases for some \\nHFEs \\nand decr\\neases\\n for others\\n.  Sensitivity analys\\nis increasing and decreasing these HEPs by \\na factor of 5 results in an increase in CCDP of \\n135\\n percent and decrease in CCDP\\n of \\n27 percent, respectively\\n.  72-Hour AC Power Recovery Requirement\\n.  Th\\nis analysis eliminated t\\nhe 72\\n-hour AC \\npower recovery credit\\n for ELAP scenarios with successful implementation of the re\\nquired \\nFLEX mitigation strategies.  \\nRequiring AC power recovery within 72\\n hours as originally \\nincluded in the SPAR model \\nresults in an approximately \\n34 percent\\n increase in CCDP \\nwithout a clear technical basis.\\n7  Potential \\nEffect\\ns of \\nBypassing ESW \\nStrainer\\n.  During the event, operators successfully \\nbypassed ESW train ‚B™ strainer\\n and EDG ‚B™ \\nsuccessfully \\nran throughout the event \\n(greater than 24\\n hours)\\n.  Operators monitored EDG ‚B™ parameters and did not identify \\nperformance \\nissues \\nwith \\nthe reduce \\nESW flowrate reduced by 300 gpm.\\n  However, \\ncooling the EDG ‚B™ with the strainer bypassed would result in an unknown decrease \\nin \\nreliability due to increase f\\nouling/plugging potential with the EDG ‚B™ coolers.  \\nA sensitivity case with \\nthe EDG ‚B™ \\nFTR probability doubled \\nresults in a\\nn inc\\nrease in\\n CCDP \\nof \\napproximately\\n 89 percent\\n.

An \\nauxiliary operator (AO) was sent in accordance with the \\n\\nalarm response procedure. When the operator arrived, the \\nESW train ‚B™ strainer differential pressure reached 15\\n psid \\nand was directed by the main control room operators to \\nbypass the strainer. This was completed within 15\\n minutes. \\nTherefore, the nominal t\\nime for this HFE is assumed to be \\n5 minutes for diagnosis and 10\\n minutes for action.\\n  Although ESW train ‚B™ flow to its respective EDG had \\ndecreased dropped from 1100 to 800\\n gpm, operators did not \\nobserve any degradation in EDG ‚B™ performance. It is \\nbeli\\neved that strainer debris loading peaked at this level (as \\nindicated by the ESW train ‚A™ not increasing after reaching \\n11 psid even though its strainer was not bypassed). It is \\npossible that EDG ‚B™ would have continued to run \\nsatisfactorily with the plug\\nged strainer with a differential \\npressure of 15\\n psid. For this event assessment, it is assumed \\nthat operators would have approximately 1\\n hour to bypass \\nthe strainer, which is could be potential conservative.

We understand that the decision to credit HPCI averted undue \\nconservatism.  The decision to credit HPCI \\nwas researched and even informed by \\nthermal\\n-hydraulic analysis.  We believe this approach to increase realism of the PRA \\nanalysis is a strength.\\n  NRR, Section 3.3:\\n We noted that the analysis adjusted the portable FLEX equipment to a \\n24-hour mission time to \\nestimate \\nFTR probability. \\n While we understand a 72\\n-hour mission \\ntime would be overly conservative, would a 24\\n-hour mission time be potentially non\\n-conservative? \\n However, since the analysis has identified failure probabilities of FLEX \\nequipment as a key u\\nncertainty and performed appropriate sensitivity analysis, we do not \\nconsider this observation as a substantive comment.\\n  NRR, Section 4.1:\\n The use of a mean value rather than a point estimate is acceptable and \\nsupported by references such as NUREG\\n-1489, an\\nd NUREG\\n-1855.\\n D.2\\n Comments Requiring Response or Change\\n  Region 3, Executive Summary:\\n The \\nExecutive Summary\\n states the following\\n: ﬁAlthough \\nthe preliminary mean CCDP of 1\\n×10-3 for this event currently meets the criterion for a \\nsignificant precursor, the risk to the public remained very low because defense in depth and \\nplant\\n-wide safety margins were maintained.ﬂ  This sentence is simultaneously describing the \\nrisk as both high a\\nnd low.  In the interest of clarity and consistency of our message about \\nthe high safety significance of this issue, consider changing the wording.  One possible \\nalternative would be: ﬁthe risk of core damage was mitigated because defense in depth and \\nplan\\nt-wide safety margins were maintained.ﬂ\\n RES Response/Action:\\n The suggested change \\nwas\\n implemented in the final report\\n.

Recall that the \\n‚B™ train \\nESW \\nstrainer reached 15\\n psid and required bypassing due to debri\\ns loading. \\n The ‚A™ train strainer reached 11\\n psid and did not require bypassing but represented a potential \\nchallenge or a ﬁnear miss.ﬂ  This challenge to both trains of \\nESW \\nis one of the main drivers \\nof the high \\nCCDP \\nand the reason that the LIC\\n-504 effor\\nt was started.  Consider adding \\nthese insights in the \\nExecutive Summary\\n and the \\nEvent Description\\n that describes how both \\nservice water \\ntrains were simultaneously \\naffected\\n.  This would have the benefit of\\n  (a.)\\n increas\\ning\\n transparency for those reading the ASP analysis and \\n(b) provide a better \\ntechnical basis for adjustment of the \\ncommon\\n-cause failure alpha factors described in \\nSection\\n 3.3\\n. RES Response/Action:\\n A description of the challenge to the train ‚A™ ESW strainer \\nwas\\n added to the \\nExecutive Summary\\n and \\nSection 2.1\\n of the final report\\n.  Region 3, \\nExecutive Summary and Section 2.1\\n: Considered changing the following \\nsentence: ﬁThe licensee later determined that damage to the reactor building resulted in the \\nsecondary containment being inoperable according to TS due to i\\nnsufficient vacuum.ﬂ  \\nSuggested replacement: ﬁThe licensee later determined that, although damaged, secondary \\n\\ncontainment remained functional throughout the event and if challenged, would have \\nprevented a radiological release to the environment.  However, \\nwhen tested, the vacuum \\n\\ndrawn in secondary containment by the standby gas treatment system was slightly below \\nthe very conservative technical specification limit.ﬂ\\n RES Response/Action:\\n The suggested change \\nwas\\n implemented in the final report\\n.  Region 3, \\nSection 2.1\\n: The control rod drive (\\nCRD\\n) pumps were impacted by using the \\nmain steam line drains to the condenser for cooldown.  The operating CRD pump developed \\n\\na seal leak.  The standby pump was started, and th\\ne pump became vapor bound due to the \\nhigh temperature at the suction of the pump.  Consider whether the report should discuss \\nthis impact and model as appropriate given that CRD is a BWR alternate injection source for \\nlate injection.  While this condition \\nwould not impact the current dominant sequences, it \\ncould impact other LOOP core damage sequences.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n The degradation of both CRD pumps \\nwas\\n modeled explicitly in the \\nanalysis and documented in the final report (\\nSection\\n 3.4\\n).  Note that this change has a \\nnegligible effect on the result because four additional systems (ESW, residual heat removal \\n\\nservice water, firewater, and general service water) are credited for late injection during a \\nLOOP.\\n  Region \\n3, \\nSection 2.\\n2: Consider deleting the following sentence:\\n ﬁThe event was not \\nconsidered a beyond design basis eventﬂ.

As it is currently \\nwritten, the sentence is not factually correct.  After the Derecho storm had passed the sit\\ne, \\nthe licensee had the capability and flexibility to pre\\n-stage the FLEX equipment.  On the day \\nof the event, after the Derecho had passed, the licensee appropriately debated whether to \\nposition FLEX emergency diesel generators.  One of the two in\\n-plant ED\\nG had been \\ndeclared inoperable but ultimately the licensee made the decision not to pre\\n-position FLEX \\nequipment.  It should not be implied that the licensee was bound by procedural constraints \\n\\nthat did not exist.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n The footnote \\nwas\\n revis\\ned as ﬁ\\nAfter the Derecho storm had passed \\nthe site, the licensee had the capability to pre\\n-stage FLEX equipment.  However, after \\ndiscussing this possibility, the decision was made to not move any FLEX equipment\\n.ﬂ  NRR, Section 3.3:\\n We noted that the analysi\\ns adjusted the portable FLEX equipment to a \\n24-hour mission time to estimate \\nFTR probability. \\n While we understand a 72\\n-hour mission \\ntime would be overly conservative, would a 24\\n-hour mission time be potentially non\\n-conservative? \\n However, since the analysis has identified failure probabilities of FLEX \\nequipment as a key uncertainty and performed appropriate sensitivity analysis, we do not \\n\\nconsider this observation as a substantive\\n comment.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n We believe that\\n if the applicable FLEX strategies are fulfilling their \\nsafety function at 24\\n-hours, we believe that is sufficient to declare safe/stable end state.\\n  NRR, \\nSection 3.3:\\n We understand the decision to remove the cr\\nedit for EDG repair during \\nELAP scenarios.  Our comment would be that this is appropriate to do on a case\\n-by-case \\nbasis, it would be useful to show a sensitivity showing how much of an effect this had on the \\nresults.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n A sensitivity case\\n crediting\\n EDG repair for ELAP scenario \\nestimates a mean CCDP \\n6×10-4 (a decrease of approximately \\n20 percent).  \\nThe issue of \\ncrediting EDG repair in the base SPAR models could be reconsidered.  \\nIt is\\n a typical SPAR \\nmodel practice to not credit strategies n\\not included in the licensee PRAs\\n, yet less than a \\nthird \\nof licensee PRAs include credit for EDG repair\\n.  In addition\\n, the nonrecovery \\nprobabilities are calculated by INL using data extracted from unplanned unavailability times \\nfrom MSPI (typically normal operations with only a single EDG to troubleshoot).  During the \\nLER 331\\n-2020-001   D-4 Level 3 PRA project, industry peer review members questi\\noned the basis for crediting repair \\nof the EDGs, which had been adopted from the SPAR models.  Subsequently, it was \\ndecided to remove EDG repair from the Level 3 PRA because the staff questioned whether \\nrepair data collected under normal conditions is appl\\nicable to SBO scenarios where \\nconditions may be different (e.g., reduce\\nd lighting, increased stress, staffing constraints) and \\nthere would be multiple EDG failures to troubleshoot.  Although there could also be factors \\n(e.g., increased priority, eliminatio\\nn of restrictive licensee processes) that reduce the repair \\ntime.\\n  NextEra, Section 3.4:\\n The preliminary \\nASP analysis \\nused the timeline that was developed \\nfor the \\nLER\\n to note that power was not restored to the safety buses from an offsite power \\nsource until\\n twenty\\n-five hours after the LOOP occurred1. \\n However, the Vinton 161\\n-kV line \\nwas restored as a power source at 11:26. \\n As the plant was in a safe and stable \\nconfiguration the ensuing period was taken up with coordinating a deliberate and \\nuninterrupted tra\\nnsfer of power from the \\nEDGs\\n to the offsite power supply. \\n Had an \\nEDG\\n failed at any point after 11:26, offsite power was available to re\\n-energize emergency busses. \\nTherefore, offsite power was available to be restored to the safety buses approximately \\n22.6\\n hours after the event started and not 25 hours.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n Based on this comment and subsequent discussion with Region\\n 3 inspectors, we agree that credit for offsite power recovery at 24\\n hours should be provided.  \\nThe applicable text in the Anal\\nysis Assumptions (\\nSection\\n 3.4\\n) has been revised.  This \\nchange results in the mean CCDP decreasing from 1\\n×10-3 to 8\\n×10-4. D.3\\n Comments Concerning Base SPAR Model Considerations\\n  NextEra:\\n The SPAR model\\ns utilize generic data out of the NRC Reactor Operating \\nExperience Database. \\n The PWR\\nOG recently reviewed the component reliability data and \\nidentified that the \\nFTR data used in the SPAR models is potentially over\\n-estimating the \\nprobability of diesel failur\\nes. \\n The PWROG\\n, when reviewing this data, showed that the rate \\nfor diesel generators \\nFTR\\n could be reduced from 1.\\n4×10\\n-3 per hour to 8.4\\n×10\\n-4 per hour.\\n RES Response/Action:\\n This data issue, along with others previously reported \\nin PWROG\\n-18026-P, ﬁComponent \\nReliability Data Issues and Strategies\\n,ﬂ \\nis currently being reviewed by \\nthe NRC and INL.  \\nIn the interim, INL performed a revised calculation \\nfor the EDG FTR rate \\nusing data from \\nthe \\n2010Œ2019 period and \\nconsistent with\\n existing Institute of Nuclear \\nPower Operations (INPO) guidance. \\n This calculation resulted in \\nmean failure rate of \\n1.32\\n×10-3 per hour (\\n103 failures in 82,768 hours)\\n.  Note that the number of run hours from \\nfailures to load/run (FTLR) failure mode (i.e., f\\nailures to run within 1 hour) is not deducted \\nfrom the run hours in the FTR failure mode in the above calculation.\\n  This revised\\n failure rate \\nis only 1\\n3 percent\\n lower than the current EDG FTR rate of 1.52\\n×10-3 per hour.\\n  Since this \\nrevised\\n rate\\n is within a reasonable uncertainty range \\nof the FTR rate used in the analysis \\nand is not expected to make a significant impact on the overall CCDP\\n, the ED\\nG FTR rate \\nwas not changed in the best estimate case.\\n  NextEra:\\n The preliminary \\nASP analysis \\nassume\\ns that\\n core damage would occur without \\naccounting for the specific failure modes that were present in the cut\\n sets. \\n The most \\nsignificant conservatism was that \\nFTR events\\n (e.g., EDG or RCIC)\\n, were assumed to occur \\nat the start of the event\\n (i.e., t \\n= 0).  Howeve\\nr, this failure mode does not align with the \\ngeneric SPAR data as a\\nn FTR \\nevent is noted as occurring after the first hour and up to \\nLER 331\\n-2020-001   D-5 24 hours. \\n Incorporating this time dependence would allow for additional credit for FLEX \\nmitigation strategies.\\n RES Response\\n/Action:\\n The treatment of FTR events in the SPAR models is consistent \\nwith the current state\\n-of-practice.  \\nThe assumption that failures occur at the start of the event \\nis in part addressed by applying factors related to convolution of EDG FTR \\nevents.\\n  However, this convolution credit does not \\nmeaningfully \\naffect the analysis for this event \\nlargely due to \\nthe \\nlong time (~23 hours) until offsite power could be recovered.  It is \\nrecognized that this treatment is conservative, but the proper treatm\\nent of FTR failure would \\nlikely require aspects of ﬁdynamicﬂ PRA, which is beyond the scope of this analysis.\\n  NRR, Section 3.3:\\n We agree with the basis to eliminate the 72\\n-hour AC power recovery \\nrequirement since that assumption introduces an unnecessary conservatism.  This raises an \\nissue in the opinion of at least this analyst that we should follow\\n-up on.  Should we consider \\neli\\nminating this conservatism from SPAR models to enhance their accuracy after further \\ndiscussions among cognizant stakeholders (NRR\\n\\DRA, RES\\n\\DRA, SRAs, and INL staff)?\\n RES Response/Action:\\n This issue will be discussed with internal stakeholders to determine \\nif there is a consensus opinion\\n to eliminate the 72\\n-hour AC power recovery requirement\\n in \\nall SPAR models\\n.

\\nBrunswick Steam Electric Plant \\nUni\\nt 1 that resulted in a reactor scram.

This accident sequence precursor (ASP) analysis reveals that the most likely core damage \\n\\nsequence \\nis a loss of offsite power (LOOP) initiating event and the successful operation of the \\nEDGs providing safety\\n-related alternating current (AC) power with subsequent (postulated) \\nfailure of both HPCI and RCIC and operators failing to depressurize the reactor\\n.  This accident \\nsequence accounts for approximately 7\\n2 percent of the total conditional core damage probability \\n(CCDP) for this event.\\n  FLEX mitigation strategies were credited in this analysis; however, the \\nrisk impact was minimal because postulated stat\\nion blackout (SBO) scenarios are not a \\ndominant risk contributor.\\n  The ASP analysis\\n results\\n reinforce\\n that a LOOP \\nresulting from\\n natural phenomenon outside the licensees™ control is a s\\nubstantial \\nrisk contributor\\n; however,\\n plant and operator response were\\n timely and appropriate to mitigate the risk of the event.\\n LER \\n325-2020-003  2 2 EVENT \\nDETAILS \\n  2.1 Event Description\\n On August 3, 2020\\n, a LOOP \\noccurred on \\nBrunswick Steam Electric Plant Uni\\nt 1 that resulted in \\na reactor scram.  EDGs \\n1 and 2 automatically \\nstarted and loaded to the\\nir respective emergency \\nbuses. \\n Operators manually started RCIC and HPCI to maintain \\nreactor water level\\n and provide \\npressure control, respectively\\n.  An Unusual Event \\nwas declared \\nat 11:12 p.m.\\n  At the time of the \\nevent, Unit 1 was in the process of \\nshutting down for maintenance associated with a ground on \\nthe main generator\\n and was not synced to the grid.\\n As a result of the reactor trip, reactor water level reached low level 1\\n, which results in an \\nisolation signal of the \\nGroup 2 (i.e., floor and equi\\npment drain\\ns), Group 6 (i.e., monitoring and \\nsampl\\ning\\n) and Group 8 (i.e., shutdown cooling\\n) valves\\n.  The Group 8 valves were closed at the \\ntime of the event. \\n Per design, the \\nLOOP \\nalso caused a Group 1 (i.e., main steam isolation \\nvalve) isolation.\\n  The Uni\\nt 1 LOOP did not affect Unit 2, which remained at 100\\n-percent power.\\n1  Operators restored offsite power to the \\nUnit 1 \\nnonsafety\\n-related buses from the\\n UAT in \\napproximately 37\\n minutes.\\n  Offsite power was restored \\nto the two safety buses via the SAT \\nand the Unusual Event was exited at 2:54 pm. on August 4\\nth.  Additional information is provided in \\nlicensee event report (L\\nER) 325-2020-002, ﬁAutomatic Specified System Actuations due to Loss \\nof Offsite Power\\n,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML20265A162\\n). 2.2 Cause\\n The licensee determined that the \\nelectrical fault that \\nresulted \\nin \\nthe transformer bus powering \\nthe SAT to trip and\\n the subsequent LOOP was \\ncaused \\nstorm\\n-generated debris from\\n Hurricane \\nIsaias\\n. 3 MODELING \\n  3.1 SDP Results/Basis for ASP Analysis\\n The ASP Program performs independent analyses for initiating events. \\n ASP analyses of\\n initiating events account for all failures/degraded conditions and unavailabilities (e.g., equipment\\n \\nout for maintenance) th\\nat occurred during the event, regardless of licensee performance.\\n2 Additional LERs were reviewed to determine if concurrent unavailabilities existed during the\\n August 3\\nrd event. \\n No windowed events were identified.\\n  Discussions with Region 2 staff indicate\\n that no licensee performance deficienc\\ny associated with this event ha\\ns been identified; \\nhowever, the LER remains open.\\n 3.2 Analysis Type\\n An initiating event analysis \\nwas performed using \\nRevision\\n 9.33 of the standardized plant \\nanalysis risk (SPAR) model for \\nBrunswick Steam Electric Plant\\n (Unit\\n 1) created on \\nJuly\\n 31, 2020.  This event was modeled as a switchyard\\n-centered LOOP initiating event.\\n  1  The Unit 2 EDGs started but did not load onto their respective safety buses because they remained energized \\nvia offsite power throughout the event.\\n 2  ASP analyses also account for any degraded condition(s) that were identified after the initiating event occurred if\\n the failure/degradation exposure \\ntime\\n(s) overlapped the initiating event date.\\n LER \\n325-2020-003  3 3.3 SPAR Model Modifications\\n No SPAR model modifications were needed for\\n this analysis.\\n 3.4 Analysis\\n Assumptions\\n The following modeling assumptions were determined to be significant to the modeling of this \\ninitiating \\nevent assessment:\\n  The probability of IE\\n-LOOPSC (\\nloss of offsite power (switchyard\\n-centered)\\n) was set to \\n1.0 due to the loss of offsite power. \\n All other initiating event probabilities were set to \\nzero.\\n  Basic event OEP\\n-VCF\\n-LP-SITESC (\\nsite LOOP (switchyard\\n-centered)\\n) was set to FALSE \\nbecause the event was single unit LOOP.\\n  The probability of basic event FLX\\n-XHE\\n-XM-ELAP (\\noperators fail to declare \\nELAP\\n when \\nbeneficial\\n) was set to \\nit nominal \\nvalue of 1\\n×10-2 to activate the credit for FLEX mitigation \\nstrategies for SBO scenarios for which an extended loss of AC power (ELAP) is \\ndeclared.  Sensitivity analyses show that \\nthe amount of FLEX credit \\nhas a \\nminimal\\n impact on the\\n analysis\\n results.\\n  Offsite power was restored \\nto the two safety buses via the SAT in approximately 15 and \\n17 hours, respectively\\n.  It is believed that operators could have restored offsite power \\nmore quic\\nkly if postulated\\n SBO had occurred.  However, \\nan exact determination on \\nwhen \\nthe offsite\\n power\\n could have been restored is not available\\n.  Given this uncertainty, \\nbasic event\\ns OEP\\n-XHE\\n-XL-NR30MSC (\\noperators fail to recover offsite power in \\n30 minutes\\n) and OEP-XHE\\n-XL-NR0\\n2HSC (operators fail to recover offsite power in \\n2 hours) were\\n set to TRUE. \\n Although this assumption is potential\\nly conservative, \\nsensitivity analyses show \\ncredit for \\nthe \\noffsite power recovery \\nhas a \\nminimal impact\\n on the analysis results.\\n 4 ANALYSIS RESULTS \\n  4.1 Results\\n The mean\\n CCDP \\nfor this analysis is calculated to be \\n2.0×10-5.  The ASP Program threshold \\nfor \\ninitiating events \\nis a CCDP of \\n10-6 or the \\nplant\\n-specific \\nCCDP of an uncomplicated reactor trip \\nwith a non\\n-recoverable loss of feed water or the condenser heat sink, whichever is greater. \\n This \\nCCDP equivalent for \\nBrunswick Steam Electric \\nPlant (Unit \\n1) is \\n1.5×10-5.  Therefore, this event \\nis a precursor\\n. The parameter uncertainty results \\nfor this analysis \\nprovi\\nded below:\\n Table \\n1.

As Reactor Coolant System (RCS) pressure reached 2235 psig, one of two Pressurizer Spray Valves began to dose as expected and the other valve traveled unexpectedly to the fully open position. The operators were unable to close the failed open valve.and manually tripped the reactor at 22:42 due to lowering RCS pressure. RCS pressure continued to lower below the safety injection (SI) actuation setpoint and an automatic SI occurred. All safety systems responded as expected and RCS pressure recovered to normal. The cause of the failed open valve was due to foreign material from the control air supply lodged in the positioner spool valve. The valve positioner and electro-pneumatic transmitter were replaced which returned the valve back into service. Planned corrective actions indude installing point of use filtration upstream of susceptible valve positioners or replace associated regulating valves to include a filter. This event was reported via Event Notification 54885 in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(A), 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2Xiv)(B), and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(rv)(A). This event is reportable as a Licensee Event Report in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(lv)(A).

FACLITY NAME Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 2 NARRATIVE EVENT DESCRIPTION 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LERNJIIEER YEAR SEQUeITw.. 05000316 NUMBER 2020 -003 REV NO. -00 On September 4, 2020, Unit 2 was operating at 100 percent power. The Unit 2 control room operators were preparing to perform Main Turbine Stop and Control Valve [T AJM testing. At 16:06, the operators placed the initial set of Pressurizer Backup Heaters [PZR][EHTR] into service in preparation for a planned power reduction to support testing. After the heaters energized, the Pressurizer Spray Valve(s) [AB][FCV] 2-NRV-163 \"Reactor Coolant Loop '#3 to Pressurizer Spray Control Valve\" and 2-NRV-164 \"Reactor Coolant Loop #4 to Pressurizer Spray Control Valve\" were modulating to control pressurizer pressure. At 20:35, the operators began to lower reactor power in accordance with 2-OHP-4021-011-001, Attachment 2, Power Reductions Between 89 percent and 100 percent At 22:04, operators reported completing the planned power reduction and Unit 2 was stable at 92 percent reactor power. At 22:37, Pressurizer Spray Valves 2-NRV-163 and 2-NRV-164 closed together as expected in response to a lowering pressurizer pressure. At 22:38, both Pressurizer Spray Valves began to open upon a valid open signal. At 22:39, Reactor Coolant System (RCS) pressure reached 2235 psig and 2-NRV-163 began to close, as 2-NRV-164 continued to travel fully open. At 22:42, the control room received an annunciator, \"Pressurizer Pressure Low Deviation Backup Heaters On\" and discovered that 2-NRV-164 was fully open with zero percent demand. The operators entered procedure 2-0HP-4022-IFR-001, Instrument FaUure Response and determined that 2-NRV-164 could not be closed using control board or digital controls Alarm Log Panel controls. In accordance with procedure immediate actions, operators performed a manual trip of the Unit 2 Reactor [RCT]. The operators entered procedure 2-0HP-4023-E-O, Reactor Trip or Safety Injection. Reactor Coolant Pump(s) (RCP) [AB][P] 23 and 24 were removed from service following verification of E-0 immediate actions. Safety Injection (SI) automatically actuated after RCS pressure lowered below the setpoinl All automatic actions in response to the SI signal occurred as expected. Following the trip, Unit 2 was supplied by offsite power. AJI control rods fully inserted. The Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps [BA][P] started and operated, as expected. All Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) [BQ] components and Containment Isolation [8D] operated as required. Both Emergency Diesel Generators (EDG) [EK][DG] automatically started and remained in standby. Decay heat was removed by the Condenser Steam Dump Valves [SGJM and ECCS was secured.

An Unusual Event was declared at 1258. All Safety Systems performed as designed. As a result of the LOOP, the 'A' and 'B' Emergency Diesel Generators automatically started and supplied power to the safety related busses. As a result, the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) automatically initiated and injected into the reactor. In addition, containment isolations occurred, as expected for this event. This resulted in a 4-hour event report to the NRC under 10 CFR 50.72 section 50.72{b)(2)(iv)(A) -ECCS Injection, 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) -RPS Actuation -Critical, 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) -Valid Specific System Actuation (reference EN#54826). The NOUE was exited at 1600 on August 11, 2020. The cause of the LOOP was an extremely severe storm (called a Derecho) with heavy rains and very high winds. This event had no impact on public health or safety. There were no systems, structures, or components inoperable at the time of the event that contributed to the event. This I event is reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50. 73(a)(2)(iv)(A), 50. 73(a)(2)(v)(C) and 50. 73(a)(2)(iii). There were no radiological releases associated with this event.

DOCKET NUMBER Duane Arnold Energy Center 05000-331 NARRATIVE I. Description of Event: YEAR 2020 3. LER NUMBER SEQUENTIAL NUMBER -001 REV NO. -01 On August 10, 2020, at 1246 CDT, while operating at 80% power, NextEra Energy Duane Arnold· (DAEC) experienced a Generator Load reject and subsequent reactor scram as a result of a loss of offsite power (LOOP) due to extremely high winds. An Unusual Event was declared at 1258. All Safety Systems performed as designed. As a result of the LOOP, the 'A' and 'B' Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs) automatically started and supplied power to the safety related busses. In response to the expected Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) level transient, the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) automatically started and injected. In addition, containment isolations occurred, as expected for this event. This resulted in a 4-hour event report to the NRC under 10 CFR 50. 72 section 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(A) -ECCS Injection, 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) -RPS Actuation -Critical, 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) -Valid Specific System Actuation (reference EN#54826). The cause of the LOOP was an extremely severe storm ( called a Derecho) with heavy rains and very high winds. This event had no impact on public health or safety. There were no systems, structures, or components inoperable at the time of the event that contributed to the event. The Unusual Event was exited at 1600 on August 11, 2020. IL Assessment of Safety Consequences: In response to the LOOP, the plant experienced a Generator Lockout, Turbine Trip and Reactor Scram. The operating crew entered the appropriate emergency procedures. The EDG's quickly re-energized tlie safety-related electrical busses and restored power. The Reactor Protection System (RPS) power was never lost as the EDG's were able to recover power to the essential buses quickly. This prevented a Main Steam Isolation Valve (MSIV) isolation signal and thus allowed the Main Condenser to remain available post event. As expected for this event, RPV level dropped below L2 setpoint (119.5\") initiating the HPCI and RCIC systems. Reactor level recovered quickly. The Low Low Set System functioned as designed initially opening two primary system relief valves to control reactor pressure.

LER NUMBER SEQUENTIAL NUMBER -001 Operators were quickly able to establish pressure control initially via Steam Line Drains and RCIC and establish a cooldown rate. Both recirculating pumps tripped when power was lost to their associated non-safety related electrical busses. The operators followed procedures for cooldown with no forced circulation in the core. When Shutdown Cooling was placed in service, forced circulation was re-established which resulted in exceeding the bottom head cooldown limits of 100 degrees per hour. This was anticipated and could not be avoided. On August 12, a small cut was discovered in the Reactor Building 5th floor wall that was the result of storm damage. A test of the Secondary Containment boundary was conducted to determine the effect of the cut. The vacuum able to be drawn on secondary containment with one train of Standby Gas Treatment.System (SGTS) was 0.24 inches of water. The vacuum required to be drawn by Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement is 0.25 inches of water. Secondary Containment was declared inoperable with the plant not in the mode of applicability (Mode 4, Cold Shutdown). During a review of past operability of Secondary Containment, it was determined that the cut in the Reactor Building wall likely existed during the period the plant was cooling down in Mode 3, Hot Shutdown. Secondary Containment is required to be operable in Mode 3. DAEC design basis \\ndocuments state the design safety criteria for SGTS is to \"limit exfiltration from the secondary containment during periods of primary and/or secondary containment isolation\" and \"to control outward leakage of the atmosphere from the secondary containment\". Therefore, the safety function of SGTS and Secondary Containment was maintained by the ability to draw a substantial vacuum of 0.24 inches of water with the cut in the Reactor Building wall. Although the safety function of Secondary Containment and SGTS was maintained throughout this event, the reporting criteria in NUREG-1022 for 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C) states\" ... a report is required when 1) there is a determination that the SSC is inoperable in a required mode or other specified condition, 2) the inoperability is due to ... equipment failures ... , and 3) no redundant equipment in the same system was operable.\" Since Secondary Containment was declared inoperable, it meets the reporting criteria outlined in NUREG-1022. This event did not result in a Safety System Functional Failure.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER Duane Arnold Energy Center 05000-331 Ill. Cause of Event: YEAR 2020 3. LERNUMBER SEQUENTIAL NUMBER -001 The cause of the LOOP was an extremely severe storm (called a Derecho) with heavy rains and very high winds. Wind speeds exceeded 80 mph for over 20 minutes with peaks on site at greater than 100 mph. The National Weather Service later estimated wind speeds were likely near 130 mph. These winds resulted in all 6 off site power sources (4 -161 kV and 2 -\\n345 kV) coming into the DAEC switchyard being damaged or downed. A separate offsite 69 kV line which feeds non-essential plant loads was also damaged. IV. Corrective Actions: REV NO. -01 The high winds experienced on August 10, 2020 were not considered a beyond design basis event. The systems and components responded as designed and the overall peak wind speeds were within the Design Basis Tornado. The damage observed coincides with the amount of damage expected for the event. Given this event was outside the control of the station staff and that all components worked as designed, no additional corrective actions beyond repair/recovery efforts related to the wind storm are needed.

Abstract\\n (Limit to 1560 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) \\nAt 23:02 Eastern Daylight Time on August \\n3, 2020, with Unit 1 in Mode 1 at approxim\\nately 19% power during Hurricane Isaias, a l\\noss of the transformer bus powering the Startup Auxiliary Transformer (\\nSAT) resulted in a Loss of Offs\\nite Power (LOOP). By design, \\nall Main Steam Isolation Valves closed and an \\nautomatic reactor scram occurred. All contro\\nl rods inserted as expected on the scram.\\n At the time of this event the main generator \\nwas removed from service due to unrelated ge\\nnerator ground issues and all plant loads\\n were \\nbeing supplied by the SAT. \\nBy design, the LOOP resulted in automatic \\nactuation of Primary Containm\\nent Isolation System (PCIS) \\nGroup 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 isol\\nation \\nvalves. In addition, all four emergency diesel generators (EDGs)\\n started, with EDGs 1 and 2 loadin\\ng to their respective emergen\\ncy buses per design. Reactor water level reached low level 1 followi\\nng the scram resulting in automat\\nic actuation of PCIS Groups 2\\n, 6, and 8, by design. \\nThe electrical fault that caused the transformer bus powering \\nthe SAT to trip and subsequent LOOP was determined to be a result\\n of storm generated debris. \\nThere was no impact on the health and safety of the public or \\nplant personnel. This event is being reported in accordance with \\n 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) due to valid actuation of\\n the Reactor Protection System, PCIS, and EDGs. \\n(See Page 3 for required number of digits/characters for each block) \\n(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form \\nhttp://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/\\n)  NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION \\n(08-2020) \\n LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) \\n CONTINUATION SHEET \\n(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form \\nhttp://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/\\n) APPROVED BY OMB:  NO. 3150-0104 EXPIRES:  08/31/2023 \\n Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

Unit 2\\n was in Mode 1 (i.e., Power Operation), at approx\\nimately 100 percent rated thermal power.  \\n Reportability Criteria \\n \\nThis event is being reported in accordanc\\ne with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A\\n) because it involved actuat\\nion of systems listed in  \\n10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). Specifically, the \\nReactor Protection System (RPS) [JC], Prim\\nary Containment Isolat\\nion System (PCIS) \\n[JM], and the Emergency Diesel Generators (EDG\\ns) [EK] actuated during this event.   \\n Per 10 CFR 50.72(a)(1)(i), the NRC was notified of an Unusual Ev\\nent (UE) being declared via Event Notification 54812 at 23:31 \\nEastern Daylight Time (EDT) on August 3,\\n 2020. The NRC was notified of the RPS [JC]\\n actuation while critical and the valid \\nspecified system actuations per \\n10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv\\n)(A), respectively, via an update to Event \\nNotification 54812 at 01:20 EDT on August 4, 2020.   \\n Event Description \\n \\nAt 23:02 EDT on August 3, 2020, \\nwith Unit 1 in Mode 1 at approximately 19% \\npower during Hurricane Isaias, a loss of the \\ntransformer bus powering the Startup Auxiliary Transformer (SAT) [EA] resulted in a Loss of Offsite Power (LOOP). By design, al\\nl Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIVs) [JM] closed and an automati\\nc reactor scram occurred. All c\\nontrol rods inserted as expected \\non the scram.   At the time of this event the main genera\\ntor was removed from service and all plant loads were being supplied by the SAT. Power\\n had been lowered to 19% prior to the event in preparation for \\nshutting down for maintenance associated with unrelated generator\\n ground issues.  \\n By design, the LOOP resulted in automatic\\n actuation of Primary Contai\\nnment Isolation System (PCIS)\\n Group 1 (i.e., main steam), \\nGroup 2 (i.e., floor and equipment drain), Group 3 (i.e., reac\\ntor water cleanup), Group 6 (i.e., monitoring and sampling), and \\nGroup 8 (i.e., shutdown cooling) isolation valves. In addition, all four \\nemergency diesel generators (EDG\\ns) started, with EDGs 1 and 2 loading to their respective emergency buses per design. Reacto\\nr water level reached low level 1 following the scram resulting i\\nn automatic actuation of PCIS Gr\\noups 2, 6, and 8, by design. \\n At 23:12 EDT on August 3, 2020, Unit 1 dec\\nlared a UE due to the LOOP. The UE wa\\ns exited at 14:54 on August 4, 2020.  \\n Event Cause \\n \\nExtensive investigation and testi\\nng concluded that the electrical \\nfault that caused the transformer bus powering the SAT to tri\\np and subsequent LOOP was not a result of an equi\\npment failure. The fault was determined to \\nbe a result of storm generated debris fro\\nm Hurricane Isaias.  \\n Safety Assessment \\n There was no adverse impact on the health and \\nsafety of the public. The safety significa\\nnce of this event is minimal. The autom\\natic reactor trip was as expected, and all safety related systems operated as designed. \\n     NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION \\n(08-2020) \\n LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) \\n CONTINUATION SHEET \\n(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form \\nhttp://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/\\n) APPROVED BY OMB:  NO. 3150-0104 EXPIRES:  08/31/2023 \\n Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

Due to high RCS \\npressure as the result of the SI actuation, the pressurizer PORVs cycled \\nseven\\n times prior to \\noperator securing pressurizer spray and terminating SI.  \\nAdditional information is provided in \\nlicensee event report (L\\nER) 316-2020-002, ﬁManual Reactor Trip and Automatic Safety Injection \\nDue to Failed Open Pressurizer Spray Valve\\n,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML20311A129.\\n). 2.2 Cause\\n The licensee determined that the \\ncause of the failed \\npressurizer spray\\n valve was foreign \\nmaterial from the control air supply \\nbeing stuck \\nin the positioner spool\\n valve\\n. 3 MODELING \\n  3.1 SDP Results/Basis for ASP Analysis\\n The ASP Program performs independent anal\\nyses for initiating events. \\n ASP analyses of\\n initiating events account for all failures/degraded conditions and unavailabilities (e.g., equipment\\n \\nout for maintenance) that occurred during the event, regardless of licensee performance.\\n0F\\n1  No windowed \\nevents\\n were identified\\n. 3.2 Analysis Type\\n An initiating event analysis \\nwas performed using \\na test/limited use \\n(TLU) \\nstandardized plant \\nanalysis risk (SPAR) model for \\nD.C. Cook \\nNuclear Plant\\ns 1 and 2 created \\nin December \\n2020.  This \\nTLU model includes an \\ninadver\\ntent SI actuation \\nevent\\n tree to allow the modeling of this \\nevent\\n. 3.3 SPAR Model Modifications\\n The following SPAR model modifications were made to support this analysis:\\n  The event tree branch for th\\ne ISINJ (\\ninadvertent SI\\n) event tree was modified.  \\nSpecifically, the transfers to the \\nSLOCA (\\nsmall LOCA\\n) event tree were removed \\nand replace\\nd by branching within the parent event tree.\\n  These changes eliminate \\nunnecessary queries in the SLOCA event tree.  \\nIn addition, the\\n OEP (\\nconsequential loss \\nof offsite power\\n) top event\\n and transfer to the \\nLOOPPC (\\nplant\\n-centered loss of offsite \\npower\\n) event tree was inserted\\n to account for potential consequential LOOP during the \\nevent\\n.  The transfer for the failure of the reactor protection sys\\ntem sequence was \\n 1  ASP analyses also \\naccount for any degraded condition(s) that were identified after the initiating event occurred if\\n the failure/degradation exposure \\ntime\\n(s) overlapped the initiating event date.\\n LER \\n316-2020-003  3 changed\\n to the ATWS (\\nanticipated transient without scram\\n) event tree.  The modified \\nISINJ \\nevent tree is \\nprovided in \\nFigure\\n A-1 of Appendix\\n A.  Basic event \\nPPR-PRV\\n-CO-TRANS \\n(PORVs/SRVs open during \\ntransient\\n) was changed \\nto its complement\\n under gate PORV\\n-4 in the PORV (\\nPORVs are closed\\n) fault tree.\\n  This \\nchange \\nwas made to account for the pressurizer safety relief valves not being \\nchallenged if the PORVs lift during the SI actuation.\\n 3.4 Analysis\\n Assumpt\\nions The following modeling assumptions were determined to be significant to the modeling of this \\ninitiating \\nevent assessment:\\n  The probability of IE\\n-ISINJ\\n (inadvertent safety injection\\n) was set to 1.0 due to \\nautomatic \\nSI actuation\\n.  All other \\ninitiating event probabilities were set to zero.\\n  Basic event\\n PPR-PRV\\n-CO-TRANS \\nwas set to TRUE because the PORVs opened s\\neven\\n times during the event response.\\n  The pressurizer PORVs \\nexperience \\nseven\\n demands\\n due to high RCS pressure as a \\nresult of the SI a\\nctu\\nation.  T\\no account for the increased failure of these \\nPORVs\\n to successfully reclose after the opening, the associated failure probabilities were modified \\nusing binominal expansion to account for their greater likelihood of failure.  Basic event\\n ZT-PRV-OO-PZR-R1 (one pressurizer PORV fails to reclose after scram\\n) was\\n set to \\n1×10-2. 4 ANALYSIS RESULTS \\n  4.1 Results\\n The mean\\n CCDP \\nfor this analysis is calculated to be \\n1×10-5.  The ASP Program threshold \\nfor \\ninitiating events \\nis a CCDP of \\n10-6 or the \\nplant\\n-specific \\nCCDP of an uncomplicated reactor trip \\nwith a non\\n-recoverable loss of feedwater or the condenser heat sink, whichever is greater. \\n This \\nCCDP equivalent for \\nD.C.

As Reactor Coolant System (RCS) pressure reached 2235 psig, one of two Pressurizer Spray Valves began to dose as expected and the other valve traveled unexpectedly to the fully open position. The operators were unable to close the failed open valve.and manually tripped the reactor at 22:42 due to lowering RCS pressure. RCS pressure continued to lower below the safety injection (SI) actuation setpoint and an automatic SI occurred. All safety systems responded as expected and RCS pressure recovered to normal. The cause of the failed open valve was due to foreign material from the control air supply lodged in the positioner spool valve. The valve positioner and electro-pneumatic transmitter were replaced which returned the valve back into service. Planned corrective actions indude installing point of use filtration upstream of susceptible valve positioners or replace associated regulating valves to include a filter. This event was reported via Event Notification 54885 in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(A), 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2Xiv)(B), and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(rv)(A).

LERNJIIEER YEAR SEQUeITw.. 05000316 NUMBER 2020 -003 REV NO. -00 On September 4, 2020, Unit 2 was operating at 100 percent power. The Unit 2 control room operators were preparing to perform Main Turbine Stop and Control Valve [T AJM testing. At 16:06, the operators placed the initial set of Pressurizer Backup Heaters [PZR][EHTR] into service in preparation for a planned power reduction to support testing. After the heaters energized, the Pressurizer Spray Valve(s) [AB][FCV] 2-NRV-163 \"Reactor Coolant Loop '#3 to Pressurizer Spray Control Valve\" and 2-NRV-164 \"Reactor Coolant Loop #4 to Pressurizer Spray Control Valve\" were modulating to control pressurizer pressure. At 20:35, the operators began to lower reactor power in accordance with 2-OHP-4021-011-001, Attachment 2, Power Reductions Between 89 percent and 100 percent At 22:04, operators reported completing the planned power reduction and Unit 2 was stable at 92 percent reactor power. At 22:37, Pressurizer Spray Valves 2-NRV-163 and 2-NRV-164 closed together as expected in response to a lowering pressurizer pressure. At 22:38, both Pressurizer Spray Valves began to open upon a valid open signal. At 22:39, Reactor Coolant System (RCS) pressure reached 2235 psig and 2-NRV-163 began to close, as 2-NRV-164 continued to travel fully open. At 22:42, the control room received an annunciator, \"Pressurizer Pressure Low Deviation Backup Heaters On\" and discovered that 2-NRV-164 was fully open with zero percent demand. The operators entered procedure 2-0HP-4022-IFR-001, Instrument FaUure Response and determined that 2-NRV-164 could not be closed using control board or digital controls Alarm Log Panel controls. In accordance with procedure immediate actions, operators performed a manual trip of the Unit 2 Reactor [RCT]. The operators entered procedure 2-0HP-4023-E-O, Reactor Trip or Safety Injection. Reactor Coolant Pump(s) (RCP) [AB][P] 23 and 24 were removed from service following verification of E-0 immediate actions. Safety Injection (SI) automatically actuated after RCS pressure lowered below the setpoinl All automatic actions in response to the SI signal occurred as expected. Following the trip, Unit 2 was supplied by offsite power. AJI control rods fully inserted. The Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps [BA][P] started and operated, as expected. All Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) [BQ] components and Containment Isolation [8D] operated as required. Both Emergency Diesel Generators (EDG) [EK][DG] automatically started and remained in standby. Decay heat was removed by the Condenser Steam Dump Valves [SGJM and ECCS was secured.

NUMBER -003 REV NO. -00 During SI termination, RCP 22 was removed from service due to continued lowering RCS pressure caused by the failed open pressurizer spray valve 2-NRV-164. Afterward, RCS pressure recovered to normal pressure and remained stable. The event was reported via Event Notification 54885 in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(A), 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B), and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ivXA). The event is reportable as a Licensee Event \\nReport (LER) in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), for systems that resulted in a manual or automatic actuation of the R~ctor Protection System (RPS), Containment Isolation, Emergency Core Cooling (ECCS), Auxiliary Feec:twater System (AFW), and Emergency AC Electrical Power Systems. COMPONENT 2-NRV-164-PU, Reactor Coolant Loop #4 to Pressurizer Spray Control Valve 2-NRV-164 Pneumatic Positioner [AB][PC] CAUSE OF THE EVENT Pressurizer spray valve 2-NRV-164 failed open due to debris lodged In the positioner spool valve. No point of use filtration was installed upstream of the spray valve positioner to protect from debris generation downstream of the control air after filter [LF][FL l]. A Root Cause Evaluation (RCE) was in progress at the time this LER was submitted. Any additional insights or causes found to be substantively different as descnbed in this LER will be reported in a supplement at that time. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Completed Corrective Actions The valve positioner and electro-pneumatic transmitter for 2-NRV-164 was replaced. Satisfactory diagnostic testing of 2-NRV-164 was completed which returned the valve back into service. Planned Corrective Actions Install point of use control air filtration or associated regulating valve with a filter upstream of single point vulnerable valve positioners susceptible to binding caused by small particulate.

The potential nuclear safety significance and consequences could have been more severe had the operators not responded as they did or if any of the safety features had not functioned property. INDUSTRIAL SAFETY There was no actual or potential industrial safety hazard resulting from 2-NRV-164 failing open. RADIOLOGICAL SAFETY There was no actual or potential radiological safety hazard resulting from 2-NRV-164 failing open. PROBABILISTIC RISK ASSESSMENT A Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) was completed. The safety significance of the event was derived by calculating the Conditional Core Damage Probability (CCDP) and the Conditional Large Earty Release Probability (CLERP) of the transient initiating event, with the current site Full-Power Internal Events PRA Model of Record. The assessment concluded that the event was of very low safety significance.

This accident \\nsequence accounts for approximately \\n84 percent of the total CCDP for this event.\\n 2 EVENT \\nDETAILS \\n  2.1 Event Description\\n On September 4, 2020, MCR \\noperators completed a planned power reduction from 100 percent\\n \\nto 92 percent reactor power in preparation \\nof ma\\nin \\nturbine \\nvalve testing. \\n As \\nRCS pressure \\nLER \\n316-2020-003  2 reached 2235 psig, one \\npressurizer \\nspray \\nvalve began to \\nclose as expected\\n; however, the \\nother \\nspray \\nvalve \\nunexpectedly \\nopened fully. \\n The operators were unable to close the open \\nspray \\nvalve\\n and subsequently \\nmanually tripped the reactor due to lowering RCS pressure. \\n RCS \\npressure continued to lower\\n below the SI actuation setpoint \\nresulting in a\\nn automatic SI \\nactuation.\\n All automatic actions in response to\\n the SI signal occurred as expected\\n, including\\nŠall\\n control \\nrods fully inserted\\n; all AFW pumps \\nstarted and \\nsupplied the \\nSGs\\n; all ECCS\\n components \\noperated as required. \\n In addition, b\\noth \\nEDGs \\nautomatically started\\n; however, they remained \\nunloaded because offsite power remained available throughout the event.\\n  Decay heat was \\nremoved by the\\n steam \\ndump \\nvalves and\\n ECCS was \\nmanually \\nsecured\\n.  Due to high RCS \\npressure as the result of the SI actuation, the pressurizer PORVs cycled \\nseven\\n times prior to \\noperator securing pressurizer spray and terminating SI.  \\nAdditional information is provided in \\nlicensee event report (L\\nER) 316-2020-002, ﬁManual Reactor Trip and Automatic Safety Injection \\nDue to Failed Open Pressurizer Spray Valve\\n,ﬂ (ADAMS Accession No.\\n ML20311A129.\\n). 2.2 Cause\\n The licensee determined that the \\ncause of the failed \\npressurizer spray\\n valve was foreign \\nmaterial from the control air supply \\nbeing stuck \\nin the positioner spool\\n valve\\n. 3 MODELING \\n  3.1 SDP Results/Basis for ASP Analysis\\n The ASP Program performs independent anal\\nyses for initiating events. \\n ASP analyses of\\n initiating events account for all failures/degraded conditions and unavailabilities (e.g., equipment\\n \\nout for maintenance) that occurred during the event, regardless of licensee performance.\\n0F\\n1  No windowed \\nevents\\n were identified\\n. 3.2 Analysis Type\\n An initiating event analysis \\nwas performed using \\na test/limited use \\n(TLU) \\nstandardized plant \\nanalysis risk (SPAR) model for \\nD.C. Cook \\nNuclear Plant\\ns 1 and 2 created \\nin December \\n2020.  This \\nTLU model includes an \\ninadver\\ntent SI actuation \\nevent\\n tree to allow the modeling of this \\nevent\\n. 3.3 SPAR Model Modifications\\n The following SPAR model modifications were made to support this analysis:\\n  The event tree branch for th\\ne ISINJ (\\ninadvertent SI\\n) event tree was modified.  \\nSpecifically, the transfers to the \\nSLOCA (\\nsmall LOCA\\n) event tree were removed \\nand replace\\nd by branching within the parent event tree.\\n  These changes eliminate \\nunnecessary queries in the SLOCA event tree.  \\nIn addition, the\\n OEP (\\nconsequential loss \\nof offsite power\\n) top event\\n and transfer to the \\nLOOPPC (\\nplant\\n-centered loss of offsite \\npower\\n) event tree was inserted\\n to account for potential consequential LOOP during the \\nevent\\n.  The transfer for the failure of the reactor protection sys\\ntem sequence was \\n 1  ASP analyses also \\naccount for any degraded condition(s) that were identified after the initiating event occurred if\\n the failure/degradation exposure \\ntime\\n(s) overlapped the initiating event date.\\n LER \\n316-2020-003  3 changed\\n to the ATWS (\\nanticipated transient without scram\\n) event tree.  The modified \\nISINJ \\nevent tree is \\nprovided in \\nFigure\\n A-1 of Appendix\\n A.  Basic event \\nPPR-PRV\\n-CO-TRANS \\n(PORVs/SRVs open during \\ntransient\\n) was changed \\nto its complement\\n under gate PORV\\n-4 in the PORV (\\nPORVs are closed\\n) fault tree.\\n  This \\nchange \\nwas made to account for the pressurizer safety relief valves not being \\nchallenged if the PORVs lift during the SI actuation.\\n 3.4 Analysis\\n Assumpt\\nions The following modeling assumptions were determined to be significant to the modeling of this \\ninitiating \\nevent assessment:\\n  The probability of IE\\n-ISINJ\\n (inadvertent safety injection\\n) was set to 1.0 due to \\nautomatic \\nSI actuation\\n.  All other \\ninitiating event probabilities were set to zero.\\n  Basic event\\n PPR-PRV\\n-CO-TRANS \\nwas set to TRUE because the PORVs opened s\\neven\\n times during the event response.\\n  The pressurizer PORVs \\nexperience \\nseven\\n demands\\n due to high RCS pressure as a \\nresult of the SI a\\nctu\\nation.  T\\no account for the increased failure of these \\nPORVs\\n to successfully reclose after the opening, the associated failure probabilities were modified \\nusing binominal expansion to account for their greater likelihood of failure.  Basic event\\n ZT-PRV-OO-PZR-R1 (one pressurizer PORV fails to reclose after scram\\n) was\\n set to \\n1×10-2. 4 ANALYSIS RESULTS \\n  4.1 Results\\n The mean\\n CCDP \\nfor this analysis is calculated to be \\n1×10-5.  The ASP Program threshold \\nfor \\ninitiating events \\nis a CCDP of \\n10-6 or the \\nplant\\n-specific \\nCCDP of an uncomplicated reactor trip \\nwith a non\\n-recoverable loss of feedwater or the condenser heat sink, whichever is greater. \\n This \\nCCDP equivalent for \\nD.C.

As Reactor Coolant System (RCS) pressure reached 2235 psig, one of two Pressurizer Spray Valves began to dose as expected and the other valve traveled unexpectedly to the fully open position. The operators were unable to close the failed open valve.and manually tripped the reactor at 22:42 due to lowering RCS pressure. RCS pressure continued to lower below the safety injection (SI) actuation setpoint and an automatic SI occurred. All safety systems responded as expected and RCS pressure recovered to normal. The cause of the failed open valve was due to foreign material from the control air supply lodged in the positioner spool valve. The valve positioner and electro-pneumatic transmitter were replaced which returned the valve back into service. Planned corrective actions indude installing point of use filtration upstream of susceptible valve positioners or replace associated regulating valves to include a filter. This event was reported via Event Notification 54885 in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(A), 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2Xiv)(B), and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(rv)(A). This event is reportable as a Licensee Event Report in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(lv)(A).

FACLITY NAME Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 2 NARRATIVE EVENT DESCRIPTION 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LERNJIIEER YEAR SEQUeITw.. 05000316 NUMBER 2020 -003 REV NO. -00 On September 4, 2020, Unit 2 was operating at 100 percent power. The Unit 2 control room operators were preparing to perform Main Turbine Stop and Control Valve [T AJM testing. At 16:06, the operators placed the initial set of Pressurizer Backup Heaters [PZR][EHTR] into service in preparation for a planned power reduction to support testing. After the heaters energized, the Pressurizer Spray Valve(s) [AB][FCV] 2-NRV-163 \"Reactor Coolant Loop '#3 to Pressurizer Spray Control Valve\" and 2-NRV-164 \"Reactor Coolant Loop #4 to Pressurizer Spray Control Valve\" were modulating to control pressurizer pressure. At 20:35, the operators began to lower reactor power in accordance with 2-OHP-4021-011-001, Attachment 2, Power Reductions Between 89 percent and 100 percent At 22:04, operators reported completing the planned power reduction and Unit 2 was stable at 92 percent reactor power. At 22:37, Pressurizer Spray Valves 2-NRV-163 and 2-NRV-164 closed together as expected in response to a lowering pressurizer pressure. At 22:38, both Pressurizer Spray Valves began to open upon a valid open signal. At 22:39, Reactor Coolant System (RCS) pressure reached 2235 psig and 2-NRV-163 began to close, as 2-NRV-164 continued to travel fully open. At 22:42, the control room received an annunciator, \"Pressurizer Pressure Low Deviation Backup Heaters On\" and discovered that 2-NRV-164 was fully open with zero percent demand. The operators entered procedure 2-0HP-4022-IFR-001, Instrument FaUure Response and determined that 2-NRV-164 could not be closed using control board or digital controls Alarm Log Panel controls. In accordance with procedure immediate actions, operators performed a manual trip of the Unit 2 Reactor [RCT]. The operators entered procedure 2-0HP-4023-E-O, Reactor Trip or Safety Injection. Reactor Coolant Pump(s) (RCP) [AB][P] 23 and 24 were removed from service following verification of E-0 immediate actions. Safety Injection (SI) automatically actuated after RCS pressure lowered below the setpoinl All automatic actions in response to the SI signal occurred as expected. Following the trip, Unit 2 was supplied by offsite power. AJI control rods fully inserted. The Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps [BA][P] started and operated, as expected. All Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) [BQ] components and Containment Isolation [8D] operated as required. Both Emergency Diesel Generators (EDG) [EK][DG] automatically started and remained in standby. Decay heat was removed by the Condenser Steam Dump Valves [SGJM and ECCS was secured.

NUMBER -003 REV NO. -00 During SI termination, RCP 22 was removed from service due to continued lowering RCS pressure caused by the failed open pressurizer spray valve 2-NRV-164. Afterward, RCS pressure recovered to normal pressure and remained stable. The event was reported via Event Notification 54885 in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(A), 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B), and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ivXA). The event is reportable as a Licensee Event \\nReport (LER) in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), for systems that resulted in a manual or automatic actuation of the R~ctor Protection System (RPS), Containment Isolation, Emergency Core Cooling (ECCS), Auxiliary Feec:twater System (AFW), and Emergency AC Electrical Power Systems. COMPONENT 2-NRV-164-PU, Reactor Coolant Loop #4 to Pressurizer Spray Control Valve 2-NRV-164 Pneumatic Positioner [AB][PC] CAUSE OF THE EVENT Pressurizer spray valve 2-NRV-164 failed open due to debris lodged In the positioner spool valve. No point of use filtration was installed upstream of the spray valve positioner to protect from debris generation downstream of the control air after filter [LF][FL l]. A Root Cause Evaluation (RCE) was in progress at the time this LER was submitted. Any additional insights or causes found to be substantively different as descnbed in this LER will be reported in a supplement at that time. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Completed Corrective Actions The valve positioner and electro-pneumatic transmitter for 2-NRV-164 was replaced. Satisfactory diagnostic testing of 2-NRV-164 was completed which returned the valve back into service. Planned Corrective Actions Install point of use control air filtration or associated regulating valve with a filter upstream of single point vulnerable valve positioners susceptible to binding caused by small particulate.

Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 2 05000316 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES NUCLEAR SAFETY YEAR 2020 SEQUENTIAL NUMBER -003 REV NO. -00 There was no actual nuclear safety hazards resulting from 2-NRV-164 failing open, as an safeguard features performed as expected. The potential nuclear safety significance and consequences could have been more severe had the operators not responded as they did or if any of the safety features had not functioned property. INDUSTRIAL SAFETY There was no actual or potential industrial safety hazard resulting from 2-NRV-164 failing open. RADIOLOGICAL SAFETY There was no actual or potential radiological safety hazard resulting from 2-NRV-164 failing open. PROBABILISTIC RISK ASSESSMENT A Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) was completed. The safety significance of the event was derived by calculating the Conditional Core Damage Probability (CCDP) and the Conditional Large Earty Release Probability (CLERP) of the transient initiating event, with the current site Full-Power Internal Events PRA Model of Record. The assessment concluded that the event was of very low safety significance. PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS A review of Licensee Event Reports for the past five years found no events due to similar \\ncauses. NRC FORM 386A(04-2019) Page 4 of 4    \n",
